<h4>About the Programme</h4>
<p>Project Work (PW) is a distinctive subject in the A-Level curriculum that
equips students with <strong>future-ready competencies and essential life skills</strong> through
authentic, real-world learning. Through an integrated and applied learning
approach, students draw on <strong>interdisciplinary knowledge and emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC)</strong> to
explore real-world issues. They learn to consider multiple perspectives,
work collaboratively, and develop meaningful and innovative solutions.
Through this process, students also grow as <strong>responsible individuals</strong>,
learning to manage relationships and work effectively with peers from diverse
backgrounds.</p>
<p>By the end of the PW cycle, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>demonstrate <strong>critical and inventive thinking skills</strong> in gathering,
analysing and evaluating information, and generating ideas that address
real-world needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>communicate clearly, coherently and persuasively</strong> in collaborative
discussion and in presenting ideas to a specific audience in both written
and oral forms; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply<strong> collaborative skills</strong> in managing the project effectively
to achieve the group’s goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students work in <strong>groups of four to five</strong> within their class
on a project that addresses a real-world problem or opportunity. PW is
a <strong>coursework subject completed within the first year of Junior College</strong>,
and students are expected to adhere strictly to assessment timelines and
requirements for the following assessment components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Project Summary<br></strong>Each group submits a written Project
Summary documenting the real-world problem or opportunity identified, and
the proposed ideas to address the project aim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual Reflection<br></strong>Each student submits a written
reflection of his/her analysis and evaluation of group ideas or his/her
learning about self in the process of completing the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oral Presentation<br></strong>Each student presents a part of
the project orally to the assessors. This is followed by the group responding
collectively to questions posed by the assessors.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From 2024, PW has been repositioned as a <strong>Pass/Fail subject</strong>.
This shift redirects the focus from grades to <strong>deep learning</strong>,
encouraging students to exercise greater <strong>agency, creativity and ownership</strong> in
areas they care about. A <strong>Pass in PW is mandatory for admission to Autonomous Universities</strong>.</p>
<h4>PW@CJC Social Impact Programme</h4>
<p>At CJC, PW is more than an academic requirement. Grounded in meaningful
learning and the joy of discovery, CJC nurtures students as <strong>creators, connectors and contributors</strong> by
mentoring and facilitating the implementation of proposed PW ideas through
service-learning experiences. Through authentic engagement with communities,
students learn to uphold <strong>human dignity</strong>, work in <strong>solidarity</strong> with
others, and contribute to the <strong>common good</strong> by addressing
real-world needs in purposeful and responsible ways that create <strong>positive social impact</strong>.</p>
