### **Project Work**
#### **About the Programme**
Project Work (PW) has a unique value proposition which sets it apart from other subjects in the A-Level curriculum as it **develops future-ready competencies and life skills in an authentic and applied manner.** The nurturing of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) requires a combination of interdisciplinary knowledge and skills that build on one another. PW **facilitates the dynamic interplay of 21CC** as students make sense of a real-world issue, share and embrace multiple perspectives to build new understanding and solutions. Students also grow as individuals and responsible members of society as they **collaborate and learn to manage relationships with others from diverse backgrounds**.

By the end of the PW cycle, students will be able to:
 - **demonstrate critical and inventive thinking skills** in gathering, analysing and evaluating information, and generating ideas that address real-world needs;
 - **communicate clearly, coherently and persuasively** in collaborative discussion and in presenting ideas to a specific audience in both written and oral forms; and
 - **apply collaborative skills** in managing the project effectively to achieve the groupâ€™s goals.
 
Students are assigned to work in **groups of four or five members** within the class. The group works on a project to address a problem or tap an opportunity identified in a real-world context. Being a **coursework subject completed for assessment within the first year of JC**, students are to **strictly follow the written submission deadlines and oral presentation examination date** for the assessment of individual and group components of the following compulsory papers:
 - **Project Summary**
	- Each group submits a written Project Summary documenting the real-world problem or opportunity identified, and the proposed ideas to address the project aim.
 - **Individual Reflection**
	- Each student submits a written reflection of his/her analysis and evaluation of group ideas or his/her learning about self in the process of completing the project.
  - **Oral Presentation**
	- Each student presents a part of the project orally to the assessors as audience. This is followed by the group responding collectively to questions posed by the assessors.

From 2024, PW has been repositioned as a Pass/Fail subject to redirect the focus of students and encourages them to **reap the full benefits of PW, by exercising greater agency and creativity in their areas of interest**, rather than be driven by grades. **A Pass is mandatory for Autonomous University admission.**

*With a greater focus on the learning experience and engendering the joy of learning, CJC strives to **inspire and equip CJCians to be creators, connectors and contributors** to address current and emerging real-world issues through an **empathetic, purposeful and beneficial way that creates social impact.***
