<h3><strong>General Paper</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>About the Programme</strong></h4>
<p>General Paper encourages students to actively explore a range of key issues
of global, regional and local significance and be ready to meet the challenges
of higher education and the workplace of the future. Students appreciate
the interrelationship of ideas, and become more adept at interpreting and
evaluating the complexities of the world we live in. They also develop
the disposition of active inquiry, the habit of reflection, the willingness
to convey their views in a balanced, thoughtful manner, guiding them to
make responsible decisions and to contribute constructively towards their
communities.</p>

</p>
<h4><strong>Prerequisites/Suitability</strong></h4>
<p>It is compulsory for all JC students to offer General Paper at the A-Levels.</p>
<p>While students should find the essay writing and comprehension components
familiar, having experienced a similar examination format at the O-Levels,
General Paper demands depth of argumentation and critical thinking skills
that are much more advanced than at the O-Level. CJC provides students
with a foundation in thinking skills and content to allow them to craft
well-reasoned arguments.</p>
<p>Above all, consistent effort and practice ensures success at the A-Levels.</p>

<h4><strong>Enrichment</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. Creative Arts Programme</strong>
<br>Co-organised by MOE Gifted Education Branch and Yale-NUS College, the
annual programme provides participants with the opportunity to develop
their writing and interest in art forms through a week-long online seminar
in June. The seminar comprises a series of writing and performance workshops
conducted by illustrious writers and performance artistes. Selected students
may also be part of the mentorship programme, during which they are personally
mentored by an established writer over the course of 9 months.</p>
<p>Each year, an average of four-five CJC students are accepted into the
programme.</p>
