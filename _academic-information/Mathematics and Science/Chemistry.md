### Chemistry

#### About the Programme

A-Level Chemistry covers a much wider range of topics compared to what is taught at O-Level, and involves a deeper exploration of the content.&nbsp;

  

Experimental work is also an important component. Students will need to be able to understand the nature of scientific knowledge, demonstrate science inquiry skills and relate science and society, which are the practices of Science.

  

At CJC, great emphasis is placed on the understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles rather than exposure to factual knowledge. Students will need to develop relevant skills in an increasingly diverse technological society and the department will focus on moulding self-directed learners and providing opportunities to learn from multiple collaboration and assessment platforms.

#### A-Level Syllabus

H1 Chemistry:<br>
*Not available on SEAB website as of 7 January 2025, 8am  

H2 Chemistry:<br>
[https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2026/9476_y26_sy.pdf](https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2026/9476_y26_sy.pdf)

#### Prerequisites/Suitability

Students most suited for A-level H2 Chemistry are those with a strong foundation in O-Level chemistry coupled with an inquisitive mind and desire to learn more.&nbsp;

Students must also be disciplined and self-directed to manage the workload well with asynchronous SLS lessons for content acquisition.

#### Student Testimonials

_"I think that my (Chemistry) tutor is good in teaching the class, as his explanation is clear and easy to understand… … I think that he has done a great job in understanding our class situation."_  <br>
**\- student from 1T11, 2022**

  
_"Mrs Tie is a really nice and enthusiastic chem tutor. She makes me really excited for chem lessons :)"_  <br>
**\- student from 1T17, 2022**

  
_"Dr Chin displays her passion for Chemistry and makes us love the subject as well. Across most subject teachers I've met so far throughout JC, Dr Chin proved to be the most patient and encouraging teacher. I have developed more interest in Chemistry, many thanks to her engaging lessons and support."_<br>
&nbsp;**\- student from 2T10, 2020**

#### Enrichment

Singapore Chemistry Olympiad participation is offered to students who have performed exceedingly well in JC1 assessments, and who have shown themselves to be responsible and self-directed in their learning. They will be exposed to interesting and challenging content related to their syllabus in intensive training sessions and will have the opportunity to represent the college in the Singapore Chemistry Olympiad.

  

STEM Fest is an annual collaboration between the Mathematics and the Science Departments to help students recognize the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics) and appreciate its use in addressing real-world problems. The week-long event serves as an important platform to provide learning experiences for students to acquire and apply their knowledge and skills from H2-related subjects in the areas related to STEM. It also allows Mathematics and Science student leaders to hone their organisation and leadership skills in the preparation of activities during the event.

_"Ms Tan has been a really good chemistry tutor!! I always seem to understand any topic better after a tutorial. She makes sure we get our work done without pressuring us and encourages us when we do our work."_  

**\- student from 1T26, 2022**

  
_"My Chemistry Tutor has overall been very helpful in the tutorial as well as practical lessons. She keeps us on task and is always well prepared. In addition, she informs us well in advance of the items we have to prepare for tutorial and practical, enabling us to be well prepared for every lesson."_

####  H3 Chemistry

The syllabus and assessment criteria for H3 Chemistry can be found here:

* [https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2026/9813_y26_sy.pdf](https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2026/9813_y26_sy.pdf)

  

H3 Chemistry is only offered to students who have done very well at the end of the first year of academic studies. It allows students to explore the Chemistry subject in greater depth, with more focus on specific applications related to interesting Chemistry concepts.

#### About the Programme

**What is the difference between H1 and H2 Chemistry?**<br>
The content covered in H1 is significantly less compared to the content covered in H2. There is NO lab work for H1. Please refer to&nbsp;[www.seab.gov.sg](http://www.seab.gov.sg/)&nbsp;for more information.

**I took Combined Science at ‘O’ Level. Will I be able to cope with H1/H2 Chemistry?**<br>
A-Level Chemistry does build upon your knowledge of O-Level Chemistry. However, performance is largely dependent on your consistency and effort as you study the subject.

  

Combined Science would not have covered Electrolysis and Metallic Bonding, as well as major concepts in Energy from Chemicals, Kinetics (Chemical Reactions), and structures of covalent compounds, which have been covered in Pure Chemistry.

  

Many other topics are new and all students start on an equal footing.

  

**What is the assessment format for H1 / H2 Chemistry?**<br>
In addition to the lack of Practical Exams for H1 Chemistry, the assessment for H1 and H2 Chemistry also differs as shown below:

| Paper | H2 (%) | H1 (%) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 30 MCQs (15%) | 30 MCQs (33%) |
| 2 | Structured Qns<br>[including Data-Based] (30%) | Section A: Structured Qns<br>[including Data Response Qn(s)]<br>Section B: Free Response Qns<br>(67%) |
| 3 | Structured Qns (35%) | - |
| 4 | Practical Paper (20%) | - |

|  | Assessment Objectives | H2 | H1 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| A | Knowledge with understanding | 36% | 40% |
| B | Handling, applying and evaluating information | 44% | 60% |
| C | Experimental skills and investigations | 20% | - |

**What is the assessment format for H3 Chemistry?**<br>
Students will need to answer free response questions (at least 4) in 2 h 30 min, including 1 or 2 stimulus-based questions.

  

  

**Which courses in university have A-Level Chemistry as admission criteria?**<br>
A good H2 pass in Chemistry is required for courses such as Medicine, Dentistry (these two courses also require another H2 Science), Pharmacy and Chemistry.

  

The list given is not exhaustive, and for most courses that require knowledge of Science, at least one H2 Science (not necessarily Chemistry) may be required. E.g. H2 Chemistry or H2 Physics for Engineering.

  

  

**Should I pursue A-Level Chemistry?**<br>
Individuals will have to decide and take ownership of their choices. Ultimately, the ideal scenario is that either you enjoy learning about Chemistry at a much greater depth compared to O-Level, or you require A-Level Chemistry as a prerequisite for certain university courses.
