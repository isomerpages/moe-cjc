<h3>Chemistry</h3>
<h4>About the Programme</h4>
<p>A-Level Chemistry covers a much wider range of topics compared to what
is taught at O-Level, and involves a deeper exploration of the content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experimental work is also an important component. Students will need to
be able to understand the nature of scientific knowledge, demonstrate science
inquiry skills and relate science and society, which are the practices
of Science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At CJC, great emphasis is placed on the understanding and application
of scientific concepts and principles rather than exposure to factual knowledge.
Students will need to develop relevant skills in an increasingly diverse
technological society and the department will focus on moulding self-directed
learners and providing opportunities to learn from multiple collaboration
and assessment platforms.</p>
<h4>A-Level Syllabus</h4>
<p>Click the following links for an overview of the Chemistry syllabi as
well as the assessment formats:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A Level Syllabus Sch Cddts/2026/8873_y26_sy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">H1 Chemistry (Syllabus 8873)</a>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A Level Syllabus Sch Cddts/2026/9476_y26_sy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">H2 Chemistry (Syllabus 9476)</a>
</p>
<h4>Prerequisites/Suitability</h4>
<p>Students most suited for A-level H2 Chemistry are those with a strong
foundation in O-Level Chemistry coupled with an inquisitive mind and desire
to learn more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students must also be disciplined and self-directed to manage the workload
well with asynchronous SLS lessons for content acquisition.</p>
<h4>Student Testimonials</h4>
<p><em>"I think that my (Chemistry) tutor is good in teaching the class, as his explanation is clear and easy to understand… … I think that he has done a great job in understanding our class situation."</em> 
<br><strong>- student from 1T11, 2022</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"Mrs Tie is a really nice and enthusiastic chem tutor. She makes me really excited for chem lessons :)"</em> 
<br><strong>- student from 1T17, 2022</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"Ms Tan has been a really good chemistry tutor!! I always seem to understand any topic better after a tutorial. She makes sure we get our work done without pressuring us and encourages us when we do our work."</em>
<br>&nbsp;<strong>- student from 1T26, 2022</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"Thank you Ms Goh for making sure we pay attention during your lessons-be it through your jokes or sweets. Your effort, time and questions have really made a huge difference in our learing! Thank you for going above and beyond!"</em>
<br>&nbsp;<strong>- student from 2T11, 2025</strong>
</p>
<h4>Enrichment</h4>
<p><strong><u>Singapore Chemistry Olympiad</u></strong> participation is offered
to students who have performed exceedingly well in JC1 assessments, and
who have shown themselves to be responsible and self-directed in their
learning. They will be exposed to interesting and challenging content related
to their syllabus in intensive training sessions and will have the opportunity
to represent the college in the Singapore Chemistry Olympiad.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>STEM Fest</u> </strong>is an annual collaboration between the
Mathematics and the Science Departments to help students recognize the
importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics)
and appreciate its use in addressing real-world problems. The week-long
event serves as an important platform to provide learning experiences for
students to acquire and apply their knowledge and skills from H2-related
subjects in the areas related to STEM. It also allows Mathematics and Science
student leaders to hone their organisation and leadership skills in the
preparation of activities during the event.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>H3 Chemistry</h4>
<p>The syllabus and assessment criteria for H3 Chemistry can be found here:
<br><a href="https://www.seab.gov.sg/files/A%20Level%20Syllabus%20Sch%20Cddts/2026/9813_y26_sy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">H3 Chemistry (Syllabus 9813)</a>
</p>
<p>H3 Chemistry is only offered to students who have done very well at the
end of the first year of academic studies. It allows students to explore
the Chemistry subject in greater depth, with more focus on specific applications
related to interesting Chemistry concepts.</p>
<h4>About the Programme</h4>
<p><strong>What is the difference between H1 and H2 Chemistry?</strong>
<br>The content covered in H1 is significantly less compared to the content
covered in H2. There is NO lab work for H1. Please refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seab.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.seab.gov.sg</a>&nbsp;for
more information.</p>

<br><strong>I took Combined Science at ‘O’ Level. Will I be able to cope with H1/H2 Chemistry?</strong>
<br>A-Level Chemistry does build upon your knowledge of O-Level Chemistry.
However, performance is largely dependent on your consistency and effort
as you study the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combined Science students would not have covered topics on Electrolysis,
Metallic Bonding, as well as major concepts in Energy from Chemical Kinetics
(Chemical Reactions), structures of covalent compounds, and selected sections
in Organic Chemistry, These learning outcomes would have been covered by
students who have taken Pure Chemistry at ‘O’ Levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many other topics are new and all students start on an equal footing.</p>
<p><strong>What is the assessment format for H1 / H2 Chemistry?</strong>
<br>In addition to the lack of Practical Exams for H1 Chemistry, the assessment
for H1 and H2 Chemistry also differs as shown below:</p>

<p><strong>What is the assessment format for H3 Chemistry?</strong>
<br>Students will need to answer free response questions (at least 4) in 2
h 30 min, including 1 or 2 stimulus-based questions.</p>
<p><strong>Which courses in university have A-Level Chemistry as admission criteria?</strong>
<br>A good H2 pass in Chemistry is required for courses such as Medicine,
Dentistry (these two courses also require another H2 Science), Pharmacy
and Chemistry.</p>
<p>The list given is not exhaustive, and for most courses that require knowledge
of Science, at least one H2 Science (not necessarily Chemistry) may be
required. E.g. H2 Chemistry or H2 Physics for Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Should I pursue A-Level Chemistry?</strong>
<br>Individuals will have to decide and take ownership of their choices. Ultimately,
the ideal scenario is that either you enjoy learning about Chemistry at
a much greater depth compared to O-Level, or you require A-Level Chemistry
as a prerequisite for certain university courses.</p>
