#### **About the Programme**

The value of learning H2 Biology ultimately hinges on the development of a scientific mind and dispositions while addressing the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained. The Science Curriculum Framework developed by the Ministry of Education elaborates on the development of the scientific mind and dispositions. Through the study of the H2 Biology course, students should be prepared for life science-related courses at university and, consequently, careers that are related to this field.

#### **Prerequisites/Suitability**

The Biology syllabus is developed as a seamless continuum from O-levels to A-levels, without the need for topics to be revisited at A-level. The O-level syllabus is foundational and thus should provide the necessary background for study at A-level. Students who intend to offer H2 Biology will therefore be assumed to have the knowledge and understanding of O-level Biology.

#### **Enrichment Opportunities**

The CJC Biology Department affords every student the opportunity to participate in external enrichment activities and competitions yearly. These competitions expose students to the wider, more practical applications of Biology and in some instances even give them a chance to interact with professionals in the research industry. CJC students that represent the school in these competitions are given ample resources and rigorous training in preparation. Competitions we participate in regularly include the Singapore Biology Olympiad, the International Biomedical Quiz, the Lee Kong Chian Anatomy Challenge, and the STEP NUS Brain &amp; Environment Camps. We also conduct a yearly learning journey to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum with our JC2 cohort to learn how fossils aid us in the understanding of evolution.

#### **2023 Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine Anatomy Challenge**

Team of CJC Biology students participated in the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine Anatomy Challenge 2023. Organised by the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), a partnership between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and Imperial College London, the annual LKCMedicine Anatomy Challenge is an anatomy-themed quiz.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Open to&nbsp;junior college students (Year 1 and 2), polytechnic students (all Grades), and international high school students (Grade 11-12 or equivalent), this anatomy competition puts students’ knowledge of the human body to the test through an individual quiz and inter-school team round.

#### **NUS STEP Brain Camp**
Temasek Foundation NUS STEP Brain camp brings together students from Asian countries to discuss and share ideas on the latest innovation on AI and research on Brain sciences.&nbsp;

After our 4 CJC representatives selected, they had to take up the daunting task of writing an academic research paper on a given aspect on Neuroscience within a very short duration, and they had to collaborate to pull it together.&nbsp;

While attending the lectures, our CJC students also had to simultaneously prepare a joint presentation with the other members. on the particular areas of research and they had submitted in May 2022.&nbsp; The presentations went well, and Chin Syn Yi Cheri did us proud by winning the 3rd&nbsp;placing for Team presentations.&nbsp;

Cheri and her team researched and worked on the topic of Machine Learning, incorporating artificial intelligence and programming and shared their ideas with the international students’ community.

#### **H3 Biology**

H3 Biology is only offered to JC2 students. The H3 Biology syllabus is designed around specific areas of specialization. Students offered H3 Biology will take the external H3 Biology course where available&nbsp;and offered by the Universities.

Students intending to offer H3 Biology should simultaneously offer H2 Biology and possess a strong passion in the area of specialisation. In addition, the other selection criteria include: consistently good academic performance, good learning attitude and behaviour, and teachers’ recommendations.
