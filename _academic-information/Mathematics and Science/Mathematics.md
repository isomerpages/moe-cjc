### Mathematics

  

#### About the Programme

  

The CJC Mathematics department aims to nurture effective problem solvers and critical thinkers based on the Singapore Mathematics Framework:

*   Understanding and applying mathematical concepts and skills in a variety of contexts, including the manipulation of mathematical expressions and the use of graphic calculators&nbsp;
    
*   Reasoning and communicating mathematically through writing mathematical explanations, arguments and proofs, and inferences&nbsp;
    
*   Solving unfamiliar problems; translating common realistic contexts into mathematics; interpreting and evaluating mathematical results, and using the results to make predictions, or comment on the context
    

  

The department builds a strong foundation in Mathematics students, using Polya’s Problem Solving Model and caters to the varying readiness of students through differentiated instruction pedagogy. Other key teaching approaches regularly used by the department include mathematical modelling, teacher-directed inquiry, blended learning and Mathematical discourses (Stein).&nbsp;

  

A graphic calculator (GC) is a key learning tool that is designed to help students visualize and better understand concepts in mathematics and science, and the use of a GC is expected for all Mathematics subjects. Examination papers will be set with the assumption that candidates will have access to a GC. The college uses the model by Texas Instruments.

#### Prerequisites/Suitability

Learning Mathematics is optional at the A-Level. However, it is offered by almost all students. The purpose of reading A-Level Mathematics is two-fold. Firstly, it provides students, regardless of their intended course of study at University, with a useful set of tools and analytical skills to support not just tertiary study but also to sharpen their problem solving skills in the digital era. Secondly, learning mathematics exposes students to computational and logical thinking that complements other ways of thinking developed through the other disciplines.

  

In Secondary schools, all students learn O-Level Mathematics while students with an aptitude and interest in mathematics also offer Additional Mathematics. The learning of Mathematics at the A-Level builds on students’ prior knowledge and skills in O-Level Mathematics and Additional Mathematics.&nbsp;

  

To cater to the diverse needs, interests and abilities of students, the A-Level Mathematics Curriculum comprises a suite of 3 syllabuses:

• H1 Mathematics;

• H2 Mathematics; and

• H3 Mathematics (in collaboration with SAJC and local universities)

  

O-Level Mathematics provides the assumed knowledge for H1 Mathematics while Additional Mathematics provides the assumed knowledge for H2 Mathematics. H3 Mathematics is an extension of H2 Mathematics in terms of higher-order problem solving and proving skills.

  

H1 Mathematics is suited for students who are more inclined towards the arts and humanities, who intend to offer Mathematics as a contrasting subject, and who intend to pursue business and social sciences at university, and have no Additional Mathematics background.

  

H2 Mathematics is suited for students who are interested in Science, strong in Mathematics and offers Mathematics because it supports their future in science. They may also generally be strong in mathematics, but prefer a non-science based course and thus intend to offer mathematics as a contrasting subject.

#### Student Testimonials

_“Now I realised that a lot of things in life can be modelled using Maths.”_&nbsp;<br>
Tan Sow Young, 2T14 (class of 2022)

  

_“The Maths Learning Experiences has made me more open to new strategies and perspectives of looking at Maths… I enjoy applying math to real life situations.”_<br>
Lee Zhi Qiang, 2T08 (class of 2022)

  

_“The intellectual and critical thinking skills that I have acquired are useful when I meet new people in the future, to help me express my thoughts and ideas to others.”_<br>
Li Jiaxin, Sharon, 2T23 (Class of 2022)

#### Enrichment

1\) International Mathematical Modelling Challenge

Organised by Mathematical Modelling Singapore, the Challenge seeks to promote the teaching of mathematical modelling and applications to all ages. This is based on the belief that the use of Mathematics helps one to better understand, analyse and solve real-life problems that are seemingly not related to Mathematics.

  

The competition is open to JC2 students who are shortlisted based on their JC1 performance and tutor recommendations. The shortlisted students are mentored by a teacher advisor who will prepare them for the Challenge.

  

WOW Factor: Real world problems require students to integrate knowledge from different topics of Mathematics for their analysis and solution. Real problems take time and teamwork. The IMMC provides students with a deeper experience both of how mathematics can explain our world and what working with mathematics looks like. The participants have to be resourceful, do independent research as well as work closely as a team. One of the team members must have knowledge of Python programming. Students also have the opportunity to hone their Scientific Report Summary writing skills. Team CJC has consistently been achieving at least a merit in the Challenge.&nbsp;

2\) Data Science Competition

  

This is a team-based competition open to students in their second year. Organized by the National University of Singapore Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, the annual competition encourages students to explore creative data displays.&nbsp;

  

WOW Factor: Mentored by a tutor, 4-5 participants per team are challenged to apply research skills and perform statistical analysis using concepts that they learnt from H2 Mathematics to create a poster of an authentic social issue of their interest. Students also have the opportunity to hone their skills in data collection, statistical report writing and design.

  

3\) Design using Graphing Calculator Competition

  

The competition is open to all students studying in a Junior College / Centralised Institute or a Secondary School in Singapore or the equivalent in Malaysia.&nbsp;

  

WOW Factor: Participants are challenged to do independent research and use the Graphing Calculator to create artwork based on a theme. They get to appreciate how to apply knowledge of the different graphs learnt in H2 Mathematics to design! CJC students have consistently been obtaining at least a bronze medal each year.&nbsp;

4\) Singapore Mathematical Olympiads and Australian Maths competition

  

This is open to all students who are keen to challenge themselves in solving non-routine problems. For SMO, the college engages an external trainer to prepare for the competition. AMC is open only to JC1 students. CJC has consistently been achieving the Commendation Award.&nbsp;

#### H3 Mathematics

**H3 Mathematics is suited for students who are interested and strong in mathematics and intend to study mathematics or mathematics-related university course. It is offered to students who do exceptionally well in JC1.  **

  

CJC and SAJC conduct the programme jointly, in collaboration with NUS and NTU-NIE.&nbsp;
