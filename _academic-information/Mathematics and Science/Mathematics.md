<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<h4>About the Programme</h4>
<p>The CJC Mathematics department aims to nurture effective problem solvers
and critical thinkers based on the Singapore Mathematics Framework:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understanding and applying mathematical concepts and skills in a variety
of contexts, including the manipulation of mathematical expressions and
the use of graphic calculators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasoning and communicating mathematically through writing mathematical
explanations, arguments and proofs, and inferences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solving unfamiliar problems; translating common realistic contexts into
mathematics; interpreting and evaluating mathematical results, and using
the results to make predictions, or comment on the context</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The department builds a strong foundation in Mathematics students, using
Polya’s Problem Solving Model and caters to the varying readiness of students
through differentiated instruction pedagogy. Other key teaching approaches
regularly used by the department include mathematical modelling, teacher-directed
inquiry, blended learning and Mathematical discourses (Stein).</p>
<p>A graphic calculator (GC) is a key learning tool that is designed to help
students visualize and better understand concepts in mathematics and science,
and the use of a GC is expected for all Mathematics subjects. Examination
papers will be set with the assumption that candidates will have access
to a GC. The college uses the model by Texas Instruments.</p>

</p>
<h4>Prerequisites/Suitability</h4>
<p>Learning Mathematics is optional at the A-Level. However, it is offered
by almost all students. The purpose of reading A-Level Mathematics is two-fold.
Firstly, it provides students, regardless of their intended course of study
at University, with a useful set of tools and analytical skills to support
not just tertiary study but also to sharpen their problem solving skills
in the digital era. Secondly, learning mathematics exposes students to
computational and logical thinking that complements other ways of thinking
developed through the other disciplines.</p>
<p>To cater to the diverse needs, interests and abilities of students, the
A-Level Mathematics Curriculum offered by the department comprises a suite
of 3 syllabuses:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>H1 Mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H2 Mathematics and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H3 Mathematics (in collaboration with SAJC and NUS and NTU-NIE)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>H1 Mathematics is designed to provide students with a foundation in mathematics
and statistics that will support their business or social sciences studies
at the university. It is particularly appropriate for students without
an Additional Mathematics background because it offers an opportunity for
them to learn important mathematical concepts and skills in algebra and
calculus that are covered in Additional Mathematics. Students will also
learn basic statistical methods that are necessary for studies in business
and social sciences.
<br>Assumed knowledge: <strong>G3 Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>H2 Mathematics is designed to prepare students for a range of university
courses, including mathematics, sciences and related courses, where a good
foundation in mathematics is required. It develops mathematical thinking
and reasoning skills that are essential for further learning of mathematics.
Through the applications of mathematics, students also develop an appreciation
of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and to the real
world.
<br>Assumed knowledge: <strong>G3 Additional Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who did not offer Additional Mathematics may still take H2 Mathematics,
but they will be required to bridge the assumed knowledge gap during the
course of study. These students will be briefed on the rigour and expectations
of H2 Mathematics, as well as the college’s merit-based allocation process
before making their subject choices. In the event that H2 Mathematics is
over-subscribed, selection will be based on academic merit, including performance
in O-Level Additional Mathematics or an equivalent subject.</p>
<p>H3 Mathematics is designed for students with the passion and ability in
mathematics. It aims to engage students who are keen to specialise in mathematics
in solving more challenging problems in mathematics and proving mathematical
results. Students will learn useful techniques and results, related to
the content in H2 Mathematics, to solve mathematical problems and prove
mathematical statements. In the course of learning, students will develop
an understanding of the rigour of mathematics and mathematical proof and
a deeper insight into the practice, value and beauty of mathematics.
<br>Pre-requisite: H2 Mathematics</p>
<h4>Assessment</h4>
<p>Formative and Summative Assessment Assessment is an integral part of the
teaching and learning. It can be formative or summative or both.</p>
<p>The process of assessment is embedded in the planning of the lessons.
Various teaching actions will be integrated into classroom instruction
to help teachers to check if learning is taking place as intended, and
how students can build on past knowledge and experiences to move forward
in their learning. The embedding of assessment process may take the following
forms:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Class Activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classroom Discourse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual or Group Tasks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment provides feedback for both students and teachers.</p>
<h5>School-based Assessments</h5>
<p>We will carry out our own school-based assessments (SBA), which could
be formative or summative, at different stages of students’ learning and
at different points in time.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to SBA (from 2024 JC1 Intake)</strong>
<br>Mid-year Examination will be removed in phases: JC1/Pre-U1 in 2024, JC2/Pre-U2
in 2025, and Pre-U3 in 2026.</p>
<p>As with the primary and secondary schools, changes to SBA for the JCs/MI
are intended to support schools in reducing the excessive focus on examinations,
and provide more time and space for the development of 21CC. This will
also provide JC/MI students with a more coherent education experience as
they transit from secondary education to the A-Level.</p>
<p>When planning SBA, the department will adopt the three guiding principles
from MOE:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Guiding Principle 1: Schools should use assessment information to provide
feedback to students, improve teaching and learning practices, and make
sound school-based decisions on assessment-related issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guiding Principle 2: Schools should design assessments according to the
stipulated assessment objectives in the subject syllabuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guiding Principle 3: Schools should ensure a manageable assessment load
and demand on students that supports sustainable learning when drawing
up assessment plans and schedules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>National Examinations</h5>
<p>The first year of examination of the revised H1 Mathematics, H2 Mathematics,
and H3 Mathematics is 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Objectives and Weightings</strong> 
<br>The assessment objectives (AOs) reflect the emphases of the syllabuses
and describe what students should know and be able to do with the concepts
and skills learned in each syllabus. In alignment with the 2020 Secondary
Mathematics Curriculum, the AOs for the A-Level Mathematics Curriculum
have been revised to reflect the cognitive skills required to solve examination
questions.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Objectives Descriptors</strong> 
<br><strong>AO1 Use mathematical techniques and procedures</strong>

<h4>Stretch Programmes</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>International Mathematical Modelling Challenge</strong>
<br>Organised by Mathematical Modelling Singapore, the Challenge seeks to
promote the teaching of mathematical modelling and applications to all
ages. This is based on the belief that the use of Mathematics helps one
to better understand, analyse and solve real-life problems that are seemingly
not related to Mathematics.
<br>
<br>The competition is open to JC2 students who are shortlisted based on their
JC1 performance and tutor recommendations. The shortlisted students are
mentored by a teacher advisor who will prepare them for the Challenge.
<br>
<br><strong>WOW Factor</strong>: Real world problems require students to integrate
knowledge from different topics of Mathematics for their analysis and solution.
Real problems take time and teamwork. The IMMC provides students with a
deeper experience both of how mathematics can explain our world and what
working with mathematics looks like. The participants have to be resourceful,
do independent research as well as work closely as a team. One of the team
members must have knowledge of Python programming. Students also have the
opportunity to hone their Scientific Report Summary writing skills. Team
CJC has consistently been achieving at least a merit in the Challenge in
the last 5 years.</p>
