#### **STEM Education Programme**

In line with MOE’s strategic thrusts and college focus in providing differentiated support for students’ diverse interest and learning opportunities beyond the classroom, the college STEM Steering committee was set up to drive the STEM education programmes. Since 2022, we are fortunate to have Dr Timothy Hu Xiao Ming&nbsp;–&nbsp;an Artificial Intelligence expert from A\*STAR&nbsp;–&nbsp;to be supporting the college in STEM education initiatives. Sr Deidre O’ Loan Centre for Creativity houses a shared maker space that supports STEM programmes.

#### **1\. STEM Fest**

<img style="width:100%" src="/images/Science/cjc_stem_picture_3.png">

An annual collaboration between the Mathematics and the Science Departments to help all students recognize the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics) and appreciate its use in addressing real-world problems. The week-long event allows students to acquire and apply their knowledge and skills from H2 subjects and allows Mathematics and Science student leaders to hone their organisation and leadership skills.

#### **2\. CJC-Nara High School Global Exchange Programme**

This stretch programme is an annual twinning programme with the Super Science School from Japan. Based on the theme on UN Sustainability Development Goals, the students representing the two schools did research, learnt about each other’s culture, hone communication and critical thinking skills, the respective countries journey of sustainability and culminated in a joint presentation on the final day to share their findings. Nara High School visited CJC in 2023 while CJC visited Nara Senior High School in 2024.

#### **3\. STEAM Achievements**

Students are encouraged to participate in various competitions to display their talents and skills in different disciplines. 

<b>(i) ETPS Scholarship</b><br> The Engineering and Technology Programme Scholarship is awarded to deserving JC1 students who demonstrated passion and aptitude for STEM.

<b>(ii) NTU Materials Innovation Challenge</b><br> 4 JC1 students who called themselves Team Masons took part in the annual Material Engineering Challenge oragnised by NTU School of Material Engineering this June. 

The Challenge involved developing an innovative alternative to current-day cement building blocks to be used in construction as we move towards greener and more sustainable urban environments. 

Each team is to design and present a green and cement-free brick prototype. The team will need to justify the choice of materials selection in their design/prototype and its morphology, articulate their design-thought processes and showcase the potential impact of their green concrete solution on sustainability in the built environment. The prototype must also demonstrate its ability to withstand mechanical loading under various conditions. 

Team Masons did the school proud by clinching runner up in the competition!

<b>(iii) Horizon Hydrogen Grand Prix 2024 </b><br>
This is sponsored by Chevron that focuses on renewable energy, particularly hydrogen fuel cells. The highlight is an exciting radio-controlled car race in which teams design, engineer and race hydrogen-powered cars. 

The programme includes a compulsory educational curriculum in which students learn about clean energy and hydrogen technology, as well as receive hands-on technical practice in design and engineering.

5 JC1 students who called themselves Team Hydronauts represented CJC in the Singapore finals on 3 – 4 August 2024 where participating teams competed with one another in a 4-hour endurance race. Despite a competitive field, Team Hydronauts managed to come in 7th out of 20 cars and did the school proud by clinching the Best Promo award Category!

<br>1. Lau Cheok Yan Jennis (1T09) 
<br>2. Genevie Lee Si En (1T19)
<br>3. Wayne Chua Cheng Xun (1T09) 
<br>4. Neilson Li Yanxi (1T14) - Team Captain
<br>4. Ngo Hoang Minh (1T28)
