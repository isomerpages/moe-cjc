<h4><strong>STEM Education Programme</strong></h4>
<p>In line with MOE’s strategic thrusts and college focus in providing differentiated
support for students’ diverse interest and learning opportunities beyond
the classroom, the college STEM Steering committee was set up to drive
the STEM education programmes. Since 2022, we are fortunate to have Dr
Timothy Hu Xiao Ming&nbsp;–&nbsp;an Artificial Intelligence expert from
A*STAR&nbsp;–&nbsp;to be supporting the college in STEM education initiatives.
Sr Deirdre O’Loan Centre for Creativity houses a shared maker space that
supports STEM programmes.</p>

<h4><strong>1. STEM Fest</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Science/cjc_stem_picture_3.png">
</div>
<p>An annual collaboration between the Mathematics and the Science Departments
to help all students recognize the importance of STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering &amp; Mathematics) and appreciate its use in addressing real-world
problems. The week-long event allows students to acquire and apply their
knowledge and skills from H2 subjects and allows Mathematics and Science
student leaders to hone their organisation and leadership skills.</p>

<h4><strong>2. CJC-Nara High School Global Exchange Programme</strong></h4>
<p>This stretch programme is an annual twinning programme with the Super
Science School from Japan. Based on the theme on UN Sustainability Development
Goals, the students representing the two schools did research, learnt about
each other’s culture, hone communication and critical thinking skills,
the respective countries journey of sustainability and culminated in a
joint presentation on the final day to share their findings. Nara High
School visited CJC in 2023 while CJC visited Nara Senior High School in
2024.</p>

<h4><strong>3. STEAM Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Students are encouraged to participate in various competitions to display
their talents and skills in different disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>(i) ETPS Scholarship</strong>
<br>The Engineering and Technology Programme Scholarship is awarded to deserving
JC1 students who demonstrated passion and aptitude for STEM.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Science/STEM/11.jpg">
</div>
<p>About 200 students (Singapore citizens only) will be selected for the
scholarship each year.</p>

<p><strong>(ii) NTU Materials Innovation Challenge</strong>
<br>4 JC1 students who called themselves Team Masons took part in the annual
Material Engineering Challenge oragnised by NTU School of Material Engineering
this June.</p>
<p>The Challenge involved developing an innovative alternative to current-day
cement building blocks to be used in construction as we move towards greener
and more sustainable urban environments.</p>
<p>Each team is to design and present a green and cement-free brick prototype.
The team will need to justify the choice of materials selection in their
design/prototype and its morphology, articulate their design-thought processes
and showcase the potential impact of their green concrete solution on sustainability
in the built environment. The prototype must also demonstrate its ability
to withstand mechanical loading under various conditions.</p>
<p>Team Masons did the school proud by clinching runner up in the competition!</p>
<p>The team members (from left) are
<br>1. Eoghan Mulyadi (1T27)
<br>2. Darren Tay Yu Jun (1T08)
<br>3. Veeramahendran Amirtha (1T20)
<br>4. Lim Wei Qing (1T27)</p>

<p><strong>(iii) Horizon Hydrogen Grand Prix 2024 </strong>
<br>This is sponsored by Chevron that focuses on renewable energy, particularly
hydrogen fuel cells. The highlight is an exciting radio-controlled car
race in which teams design, engineer and race hydrogen-powered cars.</p>
<p>The programme includes a compulsory educational curriculum in which students
learn about clean energy and hydrogen technology, as well as receive hands-on
technical practice in design and engineering.</p>
<p>5 JC1 students who called themselves Team Hydronauts represented CJC in
the Singapore finals on 3 – 4 August 2024 where participating teams competed
with one another in a 4-hour endurance race. Despite a competitive field,
Team Hydronauts managed to come in 7th out of 20 cars and did the school
proud by clinching the Best Promo award Category!</p>
<p>The team members (from left) are
<br>1. Lau Cheok Yan Jennis (1T09)
<br>2. Genevie Lee Si En (1T19)
<br>3. Wayne Chua Cheng Xun (1T09)
<br>4. Neilson Li Yanxi (1T14) - Team Captain
<br>4. Ngo Hoang Minh (1T28)</p>

<p><strong>(iv) Green Wave Competition 2023-24</strong>
<br>Ng Ern Nyee of 2T15 represented CJC in the annual Green Wave Competition.
For her project in the Category: Marine Environment, in which she designed
a prototype of a robotic truck to remove microplastics from beaches, she
won the Encouragement Award.</p>

<p><strong>(v) End of Year Local Leadership STEM Programme</strong>
<br>Based on the theme: A more Secure and Sustainable Singapore through STEM,
the 5-day stretch programme saw 25 JC1 science students went on learning
journeys to NUS School of Design and Environment, NTU School of Material
Science and Engineering, Institute of Micro-Electronics (Semi-Conductor
Research), AntsInnovate (Science of Alternate Food) and SkyGreens (Urban
Farm). They also learnt through talks on Climate Modelling, Artificial
Intelligence and Sustainability and perform laboratory work to create fabrics
to understand the science behind fashion and sustainability. This culminated
in the final presentation in which they applied their learning to make
CJC a more sustainable place to live and learn.</p>

<p><strong>vi) Singapore International Space Challenge</strong>
<br>Organized by Singapore Space and Technology Ltd, the International Space
Challenge (ISC) is open to youths around the world. Since 2020, we have
CJC students with a keen interest in space technology representing the
college in this competition. Our students receive mentoring from CJC alumni
who are involved in the space industry. By taking part in this challenge,
our students also receive global exposure by attending various seminars
and workshops helmed by experts from around the world.</p>
