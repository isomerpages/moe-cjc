# **Our Vision**

**`Every CJCian a Thinker with a Mission, A Leader with a Heart`**

# **Our Philosophy**
# 
At CJC, we believe that every student has the potential to be a leader. We believe in developing servant leaders who embody our school values of Truth and Love. Our student leadership development is grounded in the understanding that leadership is to serve and uplift others with humility, compassion, and love whilst fulfilling one's unique purpose in the world.
# 
# **Core Beliefs of Servant Leadership**

As servant leaders, our students learn to:

*   Lead with humility, compassion and love
*   Value the dignity of every person and foster respect for all
*   Build relationships based on trust, respect and shared mission
*   Advocate for positive change that builds the common good

# **Three Levels of Leadership Development**
# 
**Self-Leadership**

Self-leadership is defined as recognising the importance of developing one’s character strengths, values, talents, skills, interest and passion, and taking ownership for one’s development in order to achieve personal leadership and positive influence.

CJC intentionally develops students’ self-leadership at the following platforms: [Student Development curriculum](https://www.cjc.moe.edu.sg/education/cce/student-development-curriculum/), [Educational and Career Guidance programmes](https://www.cjc.moe.edu.sg/education/cce/potential-development/), stretch programmes.

**Team Leadership**

Team Leadership involves understanding:

\- the nature of interpersonal dynamics, and the need to identify and customise one’s leadership style to effectively lead and rally people; and

\- that one can leverage a variety of means, including the use of new media, networking with like-minded people, and capitalizing on collaborations, to influence others towards positive change.

*   Platforms: Class Management Committee training, House Leaders training, CCA training sessions
*   Opportunities and Team Leadership Roles in CJC: Subject Representatives, Project Work I/Cs etc.

**Thought Leadership**

*   Apart from having opportunities to lead at the school-wide level, CJC also provides opportunities for students to recognise how they can contribute to thought leadership through quality insight and innovation, for the betterment of society. Platforms for Development: Leadership Training Camp, Leaders' Dialogue, Leaders' Retreat
*   Opportunities and Organisational Roles in CJC: Student Council, House Leaders, CCA Executive Committee, Class Management Committee Executive,

**Our Approach**

Our student leadership development follows a comprehensive framework that includes:

*   Talent identification and role-specific selection processes
*   In-depth role understanding and training
*   Opportunities to excel and demonstrate leadership
*   Continuous assessment and growth charting
*   Recognition and celebration of achievements
*   Systematic review and evaluation

# **Milestone Events**

**CMC Training Sessions**  
The CMC Training Sessions provide opportunities for the CMC leaders to discover their leadership style and learn the importance of having a shared vision in their leadership journey. The training sessions enable our CMC leaders with skills and strategies to build a positive classroom culture. . Through these sessions, we believe that our student leaders have gained more confidence to serve their peers and community with a greater sense of purpose and mission.

**JC1 Leadership Training Camp (LTC)**  
The LTC seeks to inspire the incoming batch of student leaders to:

*   Connect with Self: To inculcate a reflective habit to be deliberate in growing as a leader.
*   Connect with and Serve Others: To understand that forging positive relationships is the heart of servant leadership.
*   Connect with Purpose: To discover what drives their leadership.

The camp is guided by teachers, seniors and/or alumni facilitators in an experiential learning approach where participants engage in team-based challenges before processing the experience through a series of reflections. More importantly, the LTC helps to develop stronger networking and communication skills amongst the student leaders and fosters a greater college spirit amongst their peers and the rest of the college community, both past and present – for a brighter future.

**JC1 Leaders’ Dialogue**  
The Leaders’ Dialogue provides the JC1 student leaders with a platform to gather feedback from the student community to better serve them. The student leaders, coming from their various leadership experiences, are empowered to co-create solutions to challenges on the ground, while being aligned to the College’s key directions. This platform also helps to inculcate a sense of community amongst the student leaders as they collaborate together on their work plans for the upcoming year. With such intentionality, the student leaders are able to synergise together for maximum impact on the entire College community when they transit to their JC2 year.
