<h3><strong>Our Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Every CJCian a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></h3>
<p>At CJC, we believe that every student has the potential to be a leader.
We believe in developing servant leaders who embody our school values of
Truth and Love. Our student leadership development is grounded in the understanding
that leadership is to serve and uplift others with humility, compassion,
and love whilst fulfilling one's unique purpose in the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Core Beliefs of Servant Leadership</strong></h3>
<p>As servant leaders, our students learn to:</p>

<h1><strong>Three Levels of Leadership Development</strong></h1>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>Self-Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>Self-leadership is defined as recognising the importance of developing
one’s character strengths, values, talents, skills, interest and passion,
and taking ownership for one’s development in order to achieve personal
leadership and positive influence.</p>
<p>CJC intentionally develops students’ self-leadership at the following
platforms: <a href="https://www.cjc.moe.edu.sg/education/cce/student-development-curriculum/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Development curriculum</a>,
<a href="https://www.cjc.moe.edu.sg/education/cce/potential-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Educational and Career Guidance programmes</a>, stretch programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Team Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>Team Leadership involves understanding:</p>
<p>- the nature of interpersonal dynamics, and the need to identify and customise
one’s leadership style to effectively lead and rally people; and</p>
<p>- that one can leverage a variety of means, including the use of new media,
networking with like-minded people, and capitalizing on collaborations,
to influence others towards positive change.</p>

<p>Apart from having opportunities to lead at the school-wide level, CJC
also provides opportunities for students to recognise how they can contribute

<li>
<p>Talent identification and role-specific selection processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-depth role understanding and training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities to excel and demonstrate leadership</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Milestone Events</strong></h1>
<p><strong>CMC Training Sessions</strong>
<br>The CMC Training Sessions provide opportunities for the CMC leaders to
discover their leadership style and learn the importance of having a shared
vision in their leadership journey. The training sessions enable our CMC
leaders with skills and strategies to build a positive classroom culture.
. Through these sessions, we believe that our student leaders have gained
more confidence to serve their peers and community with a greater sense
of purpose and mission.</p>
<p><strong>JC1 Leadership Training Camp (LTC)</strong>
<br>The LTC seeks to inspire the incoming batch of student leaders to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Connect with Self: To inculcate a reflective habit to be deliberate in
growing as a leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect with and Serve Others: To understand that forging positive relationships
is the heart of servant leadership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect with Purpose: To discover what drives their leadership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The camp is guided by teachers, seniors and/or alumni facilitators in
an experiential learning approach where participants engage in team-based
challenges before processing the experience through a series of reflections.
More importantly, the LTC helps to develop stronger networking and communication
skills amongst the student leaders and fosters a greater college spirit
amongst their peers and the rest of the college community, both past and
present – for a brighter future.</p>
<p><strong>JC1 Leaders’ Dialogue</strong>
<br>The Leaders’ Dialogue provides the JC1 student leaders with a platform
to gather feedback from the student community to better serve them. The
student leaders, coming from their various leadership experiences, are
empowered to co-create solutions to challenges on the ground, while being
aligned to the College’s key directions. This platform also helps to inculcate
a sense of community amongst the student leaders as they collaborate together
on their work plans for the upcoming year. With such intentionality, the
student leaders are able to synergise together for maximum impact on the
entire College community when they transit to their JC2 year.</p>
