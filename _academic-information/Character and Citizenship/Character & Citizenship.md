### Character & Citizenship

Every CJCian that graduates from the halls of the college is a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart. At CJC, we believe in the pursuit of both academic and personal excellence. You are unique and special, with different interests, talents and passions. Our student development programmes give you opportunities to discover your strengths and passions.  

#### Every CJCian a Leader

With leadership development as its primary focus, our Student Development programme provides you with leadership opportunities and training at various levels and in different capacities. 

It is the vision of the Student Development department that all CJCians strive to develop themselves across all levels: beginning with the essential discovery of self, awareness of the needs of others and finally being of the service to the nation and beyond.


  

#### Leading with integrity, in service to others

Leadership without purpose is meaningless - you can achieve all that you set out to do but if it only serves yourself, then a life led in this way lacks meaning and significance.

At CJC, the challenge we extend to you is to find your own mission in life with the belief and conviction that you can and must make a positive change in the world.


  

#### Pastoral Care

In ensuring your total well-being and development, pastoral care is central to the ethos and identity of Catholic Junior College. Every CJCianâ€™s emotional and academic well-being is of high priority to all teachers.

Our unique Home Tutorial programme helps develop positive teacher-student relationship through the engagement of minds, via thought-provoking and stimulating student development lessons. CJCians stay in their home tutorial classes for their entire tenure at the college with their Home Tutors as mentors and guides.
