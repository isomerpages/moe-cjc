### Service Learning

CJC's Service Learning Programme brings CJCians out into our local community and the world to encounter and address issues which challenge humanity, giving them the opportunity to be the change they want to see in the world.  
  
  

The program weaves reflective practice, peer learning, decision making processes, exploration and investigation to complement the college's mission, building a generation of students whose search for justice calls them to act in love and lead initiatives for those who do not have a voice.

  

Every year, about 25 Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) partner with the College during the Service Learning Fair. Last year, CJCians designed awareness campaigns, structured programs for under privileged students, ran a soup kitchen and pitched ideas to improve migrant dormitories and the welfare of low-income families to the Mayor, South East District. Â 

  

Inspired by their experience in CJC, some of our alumni continue their work with groups overseas and act as a bridge between local VWOs and their junior classes, encouraging sustainability and modelling the way for purposeful leadership.
