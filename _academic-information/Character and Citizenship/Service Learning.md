<h3>Service Learning</h3>
<p>Service-learning at Catholic Junior College (CJC) is grounded in the Catholic
ethos, which calls us to uphold the <strong>human dignity</strong> of every
person, act in <strong>solidarity</strong> with those who face challenges,
and work for the <strong>common good</strong>. Guided by the principles
of Catholic Social Teaching, students learn to encounter others with compassion,
recognise shared humanity, and respond to real needs in meaningful ways.
Service thus becomes not merely an activity, but a <strong>formative process</strong> that
nurtures servant leadership, empathy and social responsibility, as students
take initiative and put their<strong> values into action (VIA)</strong>,
reflecting on their experiences in light of the College values of <strong>Truth and Love</strong>.</p>
<p>Students exercise <strong>values-based agency</strong> in choosing how they
participate in service, progressing through increasingly immersive tiers
— from indirect support to direct interaction with beneficiaries — and
culminating in student-led <strong>Local Service-Learning Projects (LSLPs)</strong>.
Throughout this journey, students undergo role formation, developing their
identity as thoughtful, responsible and compassionate leaders, while building
practical skills through hands-on engagement with real community needs.</p>

<p>To support this journey, CJC organises an annual <strong>Service-Learning Fair</strong>,
where the College partners with a diverse range of community organisations.
Through this platform, students deepen their understanding of social and
environmental issues in Singapore, learn about the work and constraints
of community partners, and identify authentic needs that can inform service
initiatives and project ideation.</p>

<p>The <strong>PW@CJC Social Impact Programme</strong> further strengthens
this growth by integrating LSLPs with the A-level Project Work (PW) curriculum,
giving every class a structured platform to research real-world problems,
design and prototype solutions, and implement a feasible class-based PW
project. By connecting empathy with action and reinforcing reflection,
students develop collaboration, leadership and problem-solving skills,
enabling them to create <strong>positive social impact</strong> while fostering
personal growth.
