### Student Development Curriculum

In developing every CJCian as a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart, CJC’s Student Development (SD) programme supports the college’s academic programmes to ensure holistic student development. The SD programme uses the social change model as students are brought through a widening spiral of growth which first helps them discover and strengthen their individual strengths, build meaningful relationships with others and eventually be equipped to make a positive change to the community and world around them. 
The SD programme aims to build Emotional and Academic Resilience through Positive Education which involves developing a Growth Mindset in students as they learn to develop their unique strengths. A safe and open environment is created for personal sharing and for relationship-building among classmates or even the larger community. Students are nurtured through a culture of critical and reflective thinking to assist them in making sense of their personal experiences in order to understand themselves and guide their future choices.

#### Religious Education Programme (REP)

CJC’s Religion Programme (Non-catholics are welcome!) adopts an approach which takes CJCians on a road of discovery of the self, community and the world – challenging them to not just be of this world, but to believe that they are an integral part of shaping it. Anchored in core values of Truth and Love, the REP contains lessons and retreats containing guided reflection that encourage students to discern their mission in community.

The JC1 Retreat takes place at the start of the JC1 year. It introduces students to the spiritual formation programme at CJC and provides students with the opportunity to reflect on the changes that are happening as they make the transition to Junior College. The retreat also allows JC1s to begin an important step of discovering themselves and to build bonds with new friends. 

The REP ends with the JC2 Retreat that takes place at the end of the JC2 year. This retreat is a significant milestone in the lives of students in the REP as it marks the end of their time here at CJC, and provides a space for them to reflect and recollect memories and times spent in the college. Looking forward, it challenges them to live the college’s values of Truth and Love when they move out into the real world.
