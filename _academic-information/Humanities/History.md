### **About the Programme**

History in CJ aims to develop their students into 21st Century Competent History Learners. Students will engage in sense making – making sense of the past in different contexts and periods and also making sense of and drawing connections to current and future global issues.&nbsp;

  

Further, in a world where fake news has become an everyday expression and a major part of media discourse, historical methods will go far in developing information literacy – so that students can analyse and evaluate sources with a more critical eye.&nbsp;

  

The CJ History department also aims to inculcate inquisitiveness, open-mindedness, appreciation for diversity as well as empathy within our students of History.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

With all the knowledge, skills and values that CJ History has to offer, it is no wonder that CJ History remains a subject that is popular amongst the incoming J1 students! Guided by your teachers, we hope that you will develop appreciation of past human experiences, critical awareness of the nature of historical knowledge, and the ability to make connections between the past and present.

[H1 History 8838](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2024syllabus/8838_y24_sy.pdf)  

[H2 History 9174](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2024syllabus/9174_y24_sy.pdf)  

#### **Prerequisites/Suitability**

There are no pre-requisites to take H1 / H2 History at the A-Level.&nbsp;

Students may find the Source-Based Case Study and essay writing components similar to those at O-Level History and Social Studies. Yet, A-Level History demands greater scope and depth of argumentation, and critical thinking skills that are much more advanced than that required at the O-Level.&nbsp;

To find out more, assess the earlier video that showcased the A-Level syllabuses.&nbsp;

3. Cultural immersion Trip to Vietnam
 
 - One of these key opportunities would be our Internationalisation Programme&nbsp;–&nbsp;an overseas exchange programme with Tran Phu High School&nbsp;–&nbsp;enabled by a partnership that has existed since 2018, where selected students will get a chance to travel to Vietnam in alternate years to meet their Vietnamese counterparts, and learn about history from alternative perspectives.

#### **H3 History**

The H3 History syllabus is developed on the assumption that candidates have knowledge and understanding of History at H2 level. As such, you can only apply for H3 History after the JC1 Promotional Examinations and taking H3 History does not replace any of your existing subjects.

  

H3 History is pitched at a level higher than that of the H2 History syllabus. It builds on the competencies acquired in H2 History and requires candidates to demonstrate historical knowledge in greater depth and breadth.
