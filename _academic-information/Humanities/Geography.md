### Geography

#### About the Programme

Geography seeks to understand Earth’s landscapes, people, places and environments by asking the right questions.&nbsp;

  

It is a unique subject which bridges the social sciences with the natural sciences. Through Geography, you will gain a more all-rounded view of the world, and understand&nbsp;**why places are different**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**why inequalities exist among places and groups of people**. You will also understand&nbsp;**social and physical processes**&nbsp;within the&nbsp;**context of places and regions**, as well as&nbsp;**man's interactions with the environment.**
