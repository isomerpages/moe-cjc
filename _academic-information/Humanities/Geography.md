#### **About the Programme**

Geography seeks to understand Earth’s landscapes, people, places and environments by asking the right questions.&nbsp;

It is a unique subject which bridges the social sciences with the natural sciences. Through Geography, you will gain a more all-rounded view of the world, and understand&nbsp;**why places are different**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**why inequalities exist among places and groups of people**. You will also understand&nbsp;**social and physical processes**&nbsp;within the&nbsp;**context of places and regions**, as well as&nbsp;**man's interactions with the environment.**

The CJC Geography programme combines authentic learning opportunities with inquiry-based learning. We believe in applying learning to real-life contexts and learning in a community of passionate Geographers. You can look forward to interactive lectures, tutorials, research opportunities and fieldwork locally and overseas.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions**

**1\. Can I read Geography at H2 or H1 level if I have not done Pure or Combined Geography at ‘O’ Levels?**

Yes. There are no pre-requisites to read Geography at 'A' Levels, though students who have taken Geography at 'O' Levels may be more familiar with a few topics and foundation concepts. 

**2\. What is the difference between ‘O’ Level Geography and ‘A’ Level Geography?**
‘A’ Level Geography covers more content and a larger set of skills. It requires added critical thinking beyond the textbook and self-directness to connect concepts with wider world case studies. ‘A’ Level students are required to read widely beyond lecture notes and be open to a range of perspectives that are not prescribed in the textbook. Assessment requirements are also heavier. Please refer to the syllabus document for information on assessment.


**3\. What is the difference between H1 and H2 Geography?**

H2 Geography students study more topics than H1 students. Please see the syllabus documents for a breakdown.

There are also 2 papers (3 hours each) for H2 Geography and 1 paper (3 hours) for H1 Geography.&nbsp;

  

**4\. How do I qualify for H3 Geography?**

Potential candidates for H3 Geography are selected after JC1 based on the level of interest of the students and their academic ability.

  

**4\. What career options are available for Geography graduates?**

Geography equips students with a&nbsp;**wide range of useful skills for the marketplace**. Employers value&nbsp;**research, analytical skills and interdisciplinary thinking**&nbsp;that Geography students bring to work as employees.

Some relevant jobs include business sustainable development strategists, urban planners, transport planners, tourism planners, cartographers, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) specialists, demographers and in fields such as community development and environmental management.
