<h3>Economics</h3>
<h4>About the Programme</h4>
<p>Through the learning and application of economic concepts, theories and
principles, students develop the capacity to assess the role of economic
agents, consumers, producers and the government, in the allocation of scarce
resources, and deepen their awareness and understanding of real-world economic
issues at the individual, national and international levels. This will
help them to adopt multiple perspectives in understanding real-world economic
issues. Students will learn to recognize how rational decisions are made,
considering the trade-offs and consequences that arise from decision-making
to arrive at well-reasoned decisions. Students will hence develop a set
of knowledge, skills and values that encourages them to take an active
interest in the domestic and global economy.</p>

<h4>H3 Economics</h4>
<p>We will specifically look at your JC1 examination results for H2 Economics
and H1 General Paper for MOE UCLES H3. You must also do well in other non-related
subjects. There will be a probation period for MOE UCLES H3. Comments and
recommendations by respective tutors will also be taken into consideration.
All these are to ensure that you are able to cope with the rigour and intensity
of the H3 syllabus while managing the other H1 and H2 subjects that you
will be offering.</p>
<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p><strong>1. Is Economics a business subject?</strong>
<br>No. Economics at the GCE A-Level is more of a humanities subject rather
than a business subject.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is Economics similar to Social Studies?</strong>
<br>Although both are humanities subjects, Economics is a new framework of
thinking and requires skills that are quite different from Social Studies,
or any other subject. A good Economics student is able to use tools of
economic reasoning to explain, analyse and resolve economic issues, evaluate
policy decisions, read critically and use evidence to help make rational
economic arguments. There are many theories that you will need to master
in Economics. Compared to Social Studies at the GCE O-Level, Economics
at the GCE A-Level requires a higher level of thinking and writing.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is Economics similar to Human Geography?</strong>
<br>While they are both humanities subjects, the skills required and approach
to each subject is very different. GCE A-Level Geography is also very different
from GCE O-Level Geography in terms of rigour and depth.</p>
<p><strong>4. What will the examination be like?</strong>
<br>Refer to the assessment description in the previous section. Be prepared
to write a lot. For example, a typical essay length will be 4 to 6 sides
of A4 paper. You will also need to use Economic theories and contextual
examples to support your arguments.</p>
<p><strong>5. Is Economics required for admissions to University?</strong>
<br>No. Economics is not a prerequisite for any course in the local universities
(including business courses). Please check with respective universities
for any updates or changes (information is correct as at date of publication).</p>

<p>While the coverage of H2 Economics is wider than H1 (see topics covered
above), the rigour expected, in terms of writing and thinking skills, is
similar.</p>
