### Ignite Talent Development Programme

At Catholic Junior College, we nurture students to become thinkers, leaders and changemakers. The Ignite Talent Development Programme offers opportunities for students to stretch academically, grow in leadership and apply learning beyond the classroom.

#### Ignite Classes

Students may apply for selection into four Ignite classes, which provide priority access to academic stretch and growth opportunities. These classes are designed to challenge students intellectually, helping them deepen subject mastery, think critically and creatively, and develop confidence and expression.

Beyond learning journeys, students gain exclusive access to top university seminars, national forums, industry attachments and academic competitions, broadening their horizons and testing their skills against high-performing peers. They are matched with intellectual peers in four Ignite classes, a signature component of CJC’s talent development programme, enabling collaboration and exchange of ideas.

#### Ignite+ Programme

Students who demonstrate consistent academic performance and leadership potential may be selected towards the end of their JC1 year for the Ignite+ Programme. Ignite+ focuses on developing community leadership and service, providing students with mentoring, grassroots involvement and service-learning opportunities.

Through these experiences, students are challenged to grow in empathy, self-awareness and purpose, learning to lead with humility and create meaningful social impact. Ignite+ students also connect with teacher-mentors and prominent CJC alumni, who serve as role models, providing education and career guidance, inspiration and networks to support personal growth and meaningful contribution.

The Ignite Conference serves as a hands-on capstone where students design and implement Local Service-Learning Projects (LSLPs) using Design Thinking principles, applying their academic learning in a meaningful context. During the conference, students are inspired by prominent changemakers, who show how to bridge intellect with empathy and use their knowledge and skills for purposeful service to others.
