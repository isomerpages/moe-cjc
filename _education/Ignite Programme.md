### **Ignite Programme**
The CJC Ignite Programme is for the boldly curious, the analytical thinker, and the aspiring change-maker. If you are ready to raise the bar, value questions as much as answers, and seek to create change in your community, you belong in our Ignite Programme.

As a critical thinker and future-oriented leader, you will be given the opportunities to ask difficult questions, analyse complex problems, and wrestle with abstraction. This talent development programme prepares you truly to be a Thinker with a Mission, a Leader with a Heart.
