### **Education**

An education at Catholic Junior College prepares you for a changing university landscape and a whole life beyond school. Over the course of two years, we bring together **a rigorous academic programme and a robust character education programme**.

Here at Catholic Junior College, curiosity, imagination and a love for learning mean a lot to us. How we teach and how you learn are just as important as what you learn. That is why our teachers are guided by these core principles:

*   **Higher-order thinking** skills, such as evaluation and interpretation, in all subjects
*   **Collaborative learning** that harnesses students' strengths and develops new skills
*   **Assessment** that makes sense: assignments and tests reinforce learning

The education of the whole person is our forte. In Veritate et Caritate.
