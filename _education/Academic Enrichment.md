### **Academic Enrichment**
#### **Economics**
This is a week-long event organised by the Economics Department for both the JC1 and JC2 cohorts. Students are provided with opportunities to carry out research to solve real-world problems, applying the Economic concepts and principles they have learnt in the classroom. This provides opportunities for students to engage in authentic learning while honing their problem solving skills. At the end of the week, the top 3 teams that provide the best analysis of the problem and solutions will be rewarded while being given opportunities to share their learning with the other students in the cohort.

Where possible, external organisations are invited to value-add to students' learning experiences in the classrooms. In 2019, the 'CPF Roadshow' provided students with a fun and educational way to find out more about the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and the importance of personal finance, through Kinect gamification. The creative use of Linoit helped make explicit links between personal finance and the decision-making model in Economics; with many students considering the aims, constraints, benefits and costs of putting aside more money for the future.

##### **Economics Week**
This is an exchange programme that allows students from Catholic Junior College visit countries like Hong Kong and Thailand, enabling them to appreciate the real-life applications of Economic concepts and General Paper (GP) topics they have learnt in the classrooms through seminars and visits to relevant organisations. Through interactions with academics and industry experts, students get to understand the complexities involved in decision making by firms and the government. 

This programme aims to enrich students' knowledge of the world as well as stretch their thinking to consider challenges and opportunities that different countries face, in comparison with Singapore. Additionally, students are also involved in school visits and a service-learning project as part of our college ethos to build Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.
