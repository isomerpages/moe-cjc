### **Academic Enrichment**
#### **Economics**
##### **Economics Week**
This is a week-long event organised by the Economics Department for both the JC1 and JC2 cohorts. Students are provided with opportunities to carry out research to solve real-world problems, applying the Economic concepts and principles they have learnt in the classroom. This provides opportunities for students to engage in authentic learning while honing their problem solving skills. At the end of the week, the top 3 teams that provide the best analysis of the problem and solutions will be rewarded while being given opportunities to share their learning with the other students in the cohort.

Where possible, external organisations are invited to value-add to students' learning experiences in the classrooms. In 2019, the 'CPF Roadshow' provided students with a fun and educational way to find out more about the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and the importance of personal finance, through Kinect gamification. The creative use of Linoit helped make explicit links between personal finance and the decision-making model in Economics; with many students considering the aims, constraints, benefits and costs of putting aside more money for the future.

##### **The Economics - General Paper Academic** **Immersion Programme**
This is an exchange programme that allows students from Catholic Junior College visit countries like Hong Kong and Thailand, enabling them to appreciate the real-life applications of Economic concepts and General Paper (GP) topics they have learnt in the classrooms through seminars and visits to relevant organisations. Through interactions with academics and industry experts, students get to understand the complexities involved in decision making by firms and the government. 

This programme aims to enrich students' knowledge of the world as well as stretch their thinking to consider challenges and opportunities that different countries face, in comparison with Singapore. Additionally, students are also involved in school visits and a service-learning project as part of our college ethos to build Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.

#### **Literature**

**Literary Evening**<br>
This enrichment programme is held annually for all Literature students. Through an authentic learning experience, students engage intellectually with key themes taught in their texts and put into practice their understanding of dramatic techniques and effects, as they create their own plays and stage their own performances.

#### **Mathematics and Science**
##### **STEM Fest**
The STEM Fest is a collaboration between the Mathematics and the Science Departments to help all students recognise the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) and appreciate its use in addressing real-world problems. The week-long event also serves as an important platform to provide learning experiences for science students to acquire and apply their knowledge and skills from H2 subjects on STEM. It also allows Mathematics and Science student leaders to hone their organisational and leadership skills.

From Escape Room to Pi Day commemoration to attending workshops conducted by Science Centre Singapore, several activities are held to cater to students' different levels of interest in Mathematics and Science. House points are also awarded to inject an element of fun and competition.

##### **Science Enrichment Activities**
Our students embark on a range of science activities, competitions and research programmes, on top of their core science H1 or H2 subjects, to further equip themselves with essential skills and knowledge necessary for higher education. Some of these programmes provide students with the rare opportunities to work with research institutes and universities so that they can make well informed decisions in their choice of study or careers after junior college.

**Our students have participated in a host of programmes, activities and competitions in recent years. These programmes have been categorised into 5 CORE Areas.**

**Creativity & Innovation**<br>
Students develop their creativity and construct scientific knowledge through the development of ideas/products (e.g. Greenwave Environmental Care Competition, Singapore Space Challenge, STEP Environment Camp etc.)

**Academic Competitions**<br>
Students' knowledge of content beyond the syllabus is assessed and they develop their critical thinking through these rigourous cognitive competitions (e.g. Astrochallenge, Biology, Chemistry & Physics Olympiads, Lee Kong Chian Anatomy Challenge, International Biomedical Quiz, Elementz Research Competition etc.)

**Research Programmes**<br>
Collaborations with local universities and science research institutes (e.g. Science Research Programme with NUS, Nanyang Research Programme with NTU, SUTD Research Mentorship Programme etc.)

**Enrichment (Local & Overseas)**<br>
Our students gain greater clarity of what they want to do in future by exposing themselves to these enrichments related to various scientific areas (e.g. Work attachment wit NanoBio Lab, stretch academic trips to various overseas universities, Materials Exposition at NTU, STEP NUS Sunburst Brain Camp, Nara Senior High School - CJC Science Exchange Programme etc.)

**Servant Leadership**<br>
Our science students develop their leadership skills as they develop and facilitate science programmes for their college & larger community (e.g. Facilitating CJC STEM Fest programmes and morning assembly reflections, Collaboration with Science Centre to teach the public about chromatography etc.)

_"My journey through the STEP Environment Camp was an enriching and enjoyable one. I was exposed to the different natural biodiversity Singapore has, such as the marine and mangrove environment, and learnt about the devastating impacts of improper waste treatment on these fragile ecosystems. Additionally, the camp has given me the opportunity to meet new friends from 12 different countries and work with them for our end-of-camp presentation, for which my group was awarded 1st place. Although the camp was draining, it definitely helped me gain more knowledge about other countries and grow to appreciate our natural environment even more."_
