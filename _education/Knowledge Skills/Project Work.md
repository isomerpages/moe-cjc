### **Project Work**
#### **About the Programme**
H1 Project Work (PW) is a subject that embodies MOE’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. Competencies such as Critical and Inventive Thinking as well as Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills are taught through PW. The subject aims to provide students with the opportunity to synthesize knowledge from various disciplines and areas of learning, and critically and creatively apply it to authentic situations.

Project Work is a compulsory H1 subject taken only in the first year of JC. In a group of four or five, students are expected to select one task out of two and develop the task into a full project. Being a coursework subject, documents for Project Work are submitted at different stages throughout the academic year.

Students are expected to demonstrate the following skills while undertaking Project Work.

*   **Knowledge Application**<br>Students are required to make links across different areas of knowledge and to generate, develop and evaluate ideas and information so as to apply these skills to their project task.

*   **Communication**<br>Students are required to demonstrate their ability to communicate effectively and to present ideas clearly and coherently to a specific audience in both the written and oral form.

*   **Collaboration**<br>In addition, students are also expected to demonstrate their collaborative skills through working in a team to achieve common goals.

*   **Independent Learning**<br>Students are to demonstrate ownership of their own learning process through an ability to learn independently, reflect on their learning and take appropriate actions to improve it. Students will be given support and guidance by their Project Work Supervising Tutors (ST) in the research, thinking and writing skills necessary for meeting the curriculum objectives of Project Work. This will be done in stages, according to the different documents.  
Project Work has the same curriculum hours as any other H1 subject. However, as a coursework and team-based subject, it is not uncommon for students to spend time outside of the school curriculum brainstorming, researching, discussing and reviewing their project both individually and in their group.<br><br>It is the College’s mission for Every CJCian to be a ‘Thinker With A Mission and Leader With A Heart’. A core belief of the PW department at CJC is that students can improve under the right environment and approaches. Department teachers value students' insights and feedback and seek to guide and prepare them for life's challenges via the learning outcomes of Project Work. Students acquire skills in order to prepare them for lifelong learning and the complexities of future work life.
