#### **What's On**
_After a two-year hiatus, our alumni were in the highest of spirits for this year’s Alumni Sports Fiesta. A glorious Saturday morning saw teams from a range of graduating batches coming together and battling it out in five different sporting events – Captains Ball, Football, Frisbee, Rugby and Tennis. Students from our CJC sports CCAs also gathered to join in the fun! (Watch the video highlights [here](https://youtu.be/ZbPdqsrPYB0))_
