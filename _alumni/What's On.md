This yearâ€™s Alumni Sports Fiesta was an absolute blast, bringing together generations of our college community once more, and reigniting the spirit of camaraderie and sportsmanship.

Our alumni gathered with great enthusiasm to take on six exciting sports -- tennis, football, frisbee, volleyball, soccer and basketball. This year also marked the debut of volleyball in our lineup. Our very own CJC sports teams joined in the action too! 

Bonds were rekindled, new connections forged, and the college echoed with the joyful laughter of old friends and new.

'Til next time!
