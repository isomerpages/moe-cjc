<p>Catholic Junior College takes great pride in celebrating the academic
achievements of the Class of 2023 at the recent GCE A-Level examinations.
With good distinction rates across subjects and strong value-added performance,
our students’ academic results are a testament to their determination and
dedication to their academic pursuits. The Class of 2023 is well positioned
to qualify for reputable local and overseas institutes of higher learning
and to realise their dreams and aspirations.</p>
<p>Mrs Woo Soo Min, the Principal of CJC, extends her heartfelt congratulations
to the Class of 2023. “Our class of 2023 has achieved very good results,
which bear testimony to their hard work, grit, and commitment, as well
as the support and help from their teachers. As a cohort whose educational
experience had been affected by the uncertainties brought on by the COVID-19
pandemic, CJCians have emerged stronger in character and with clarity of
purpose. Formed as Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart, they
are well placed to venture out to pursue their passion in the next chapter
of their lives, be it in higher education or in discerning their vocation.
Congratulations to all!”</p>
<p>Lauding the Class of 2023, Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal (Student Development)
added, “The future holds many exciting possibilities for you. I encourage
you to cherish all that you have learned, to be passionate in all that
you do, and to continue making meaningful connections with all whom you
meet. I am confident that you will continue to shine brightly and serve
as an inspiration to future CJCians. Not only have you done well, you have
also contributed to the legacy of the CJC community.”</p>
<p>The Year Head of the 2023 JC2 cohort, Mr Mark Li, also sends his well
wishes to the Class of 2023. “Congratulations on reaching this milestone
in your academic pursuit! Today marks yet another start towards the next
lap of your journey of chasing your dreams. Remember your personal mission
and where your passion drives you towards, and also be cognisant of the
community around you. Remember that the true calling of a CJCian is to
make a difference in the lives of others around us. Wishing you all the
best in your future endeavors!”</p>
<p>As we celebrate the success of the Class of 2023, the College would like
to thank our dedicated teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School
Management Committee (SMC), and alumni for their steadfast support. Together,
we are a community that values holistic development, nurturing and fostering
generations of thinkers and leaders.</p>
<p>The College proudly recognises and celebrates the outstanding achievements
of the following CJCians who exemplify the qualities of a Thinker with
a Mission and Leader with a Heart. May God bless the Class of 2023 with
