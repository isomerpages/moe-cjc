which bear testimony to their hard work, grit, and commitment, as well
as the support and help from their teachers. As a cohort whose educational
experience had been affected by the uncertainties brought on by the COVID-19
pandemic, CJCians have emerged stronger in character and with clarity of
purpose. Formed as Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart, they
are well placed to venture out to pursue their passion in the next chapter
of their lives, be it in higher education or in discerning their vocation.
Congratulations to all!”</p>
<p>Lauding the Class of 2023, Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal (Student Development)

you to cherish all that you have learned, to be passionate in all that
you do, and to continue making meaningful connections with all whom you

as an inspiration to future CJCians. Not only have you done well, you have
also contributed to the legacy of the CJC community.”</p>
<p>The Year Head of the 2023 JC2 cohort, Mr Mark Li, also sends his well
wishes to the Class of 2023. “Congratulations on reaching this milestone
in your academic pursuit! Today marks yet another start towards the next
lap of your journey of chasing your dreams. Remember your personal mission
and where your passion drives you towards, and also be cognisant of the
community around you. Remember that the true calling of a CJCian is to
make a difference in the lives of others around us. Wishing you all the
best in your future endeavors!”</p>

</div>
<p>Wan Fei is an exemplary individual who demonstrates self-discipline and
resilience. Wan Fei overcame many personal obstacles throughout her journey
to achieving academic success at the A-Level examinations. She has a medical
condition which impedes her mobility; however, she remained steadfast in
her commitment to academic excellence, making her an inspiration to her
peers and tutors. Wan Fei possesses maturity of thought, criticality and
a keen sensitivity to language — dispositions that stood her in good stead
as a student in the arts faculty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond her academic commitments, Wan Fei was actively involved in the
Nexus Investment and Entrepreneurship Society, her co-curricular activity
(CCA). Her participation in this CCA provided her with a platform to express
her passion for financial literacy, business, and entrepreneurship. Despite
not holding an official leadership role, Wan Fei made significant contributions
to various college events. Wan Fei took an active role in events like the
CCA Open House and CCA Bazaar, which enabled her to hone her communication
skills and master the art of effective pitching. Stepping out of her comfort
zone, she assumed the role of a facilitator during the CJC Nexus Experience
Day. In addition, participating in CCA-related competitions, including
the CJC Nexus FinLit Week in 2023, offered Wan Fei insights into leadership
responsibilities. She coordinated logistics, motivated team members, and
ensured project deadlines were met.</p>
<h4>Tay Hui Xin Sharon </h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p></p>
<p>Sharon demonstrated strong leadership abilities throughout her college
journey. As the House Captain of Joseph House, she guided and mentored
a team of sports leaders under her charge. Kind and nurturing, Sharon was
an exemplary role model to her peers who often looked to her for advice.
She played a pivotal role in planning significant college events such as
Open House, Cross Country and the Sports and Aesthetics Carnival. Sharon
honed her leadership skills through her participation in the 2022 JC1 Leadership
Training Camp and JC1 Leaders' Dialogue. As a testament to her capable
leadership, she was selected as one of the few JC2 facilitators at the
Leadership Training Camp in 2023 where she imparted her wisdom to her juniors.
Sharon’s time as a House Captain helped her develop confidence, resilience
and empathy.</p>
<p>Despite being involved in multiple leadership commitments, Sharon was
active in the Choir, her co-curricular activity (CCA). As a former member
of her primary school and secondary school choirs, Sharon joined CJC's
Choir with a strong foundation. She took on the role of Section Leader,
effectively guiding and leading members of her choir section. However,
the transition proved to be a new challenge as the Choir CCA was notably
smaller in size compared to the choirs she used to be involved in. This
shift necessitated a heightened level of accountability for each member
which was stressful at times, but also rewarding and character defining.
Sharon motivated her fellow choir members, and they worked together to
achieve a Certificate of Distinction for the college at the Singapore Youth
Festival Arts Presentation 2023.</p>
<h4><strong>Wong Jian Cheng, Herman</strong></h4>
<p>Herman is a keen and intellectually curious learner. During his time in
Catholic Junior College, Herman demonstrated excellence in his academic
endeavours. He set high standards for himself, and worked relentlessly
towards achieving them. Herman was generous with sharing his knowledge
with his peers; for example, Herman took up the role of a StellarNova mentor
which involved guiding a peer in one of his strongest subjects, Geography.
Herman also went the extra mile to pursue learning beyond the prescribed
A-Level curriculum: He participated in the 34th Chemistry Olympiad, and
was also a participant in the Economics and General Paper Stretch Programme
organised by the College where he learnt about sustainability and development
in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Vice President of Publicity for his co-curricular activity (CCA),
the Nexus Entrepreneurship and Investment Society, Herman demonstrated
resourcefulness, dedication and servant leadership. He led a team responsible
for managing Nexus’ publicity efforts which include running an Instagram
account and promoting events organised by Nexus. He collaborated effectively
with his peers to plan and facilitate schoolwide events such as BizWeek;
in addition, he also took up the challenge of being a presenter during
those events to educate his schoolmates on financial literacy.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Odelia Lim Wanjing</strong></h4>
<p>Odelia’s remarkable work ethic and resilience made her an exceptional
student. Odelia was highly invested in her studies; she often went the
extra mile to clarify her doubts with her subject tutors, and also put
in consistent effort to revise for her academic subjects. During her time
in CJC, Odelia was given the opportunity to participate in the Academic
Immersion Programme with Tran Phu High School from Vietnam. As part of
this programme, Odelia took on the responsibility of planning and teaching
lessons to CJC students about the similarities and differences between
Vietnam’s and Singapore's green plans. Odelia's academic achievements and
active engagement in cross-cultural learning exemplify her dedication to
personal growth and academic exploration.</p>
<p>As a Student Councillor in the Catholic Activities Wing, Odelia was driven
by a strong desire to serve God, and to serve her peers; she truly embodied
what it means to be a “leader with a heart.” Odelia, along with her peers
in the Catholic Activities Wing, helped strengthen the College’s Catholic
ethos; for example, she was involved in planning the College’s Easter Celebration
event—a role she performed with great aplomb. She was also involved in
weekly Friday masses and Lenten Evening. Her faith kept her afloat in trying
times; it is truly a testament to both her tenacity as well as her exceptional
leadership qualities that she was offered the CJC Flame Scholarship.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Kieran Chang</strong></h4>
<p>Kieran is a mature and diligent individual who shows genuine curiosity
about the world around him. He attained numerous academic achievements
during his time in CJC, and this can be attributed to his dedication, consistency
and thirst for knowledge. Kieran was recognised as the Top Arts Student&nbsp;
when he was a JC1 student and was on the Principal's Honour Roll for multiple
assessments. He topped his cohort for H2 Economics, H2 Geography and H1
History in these assessments. To extend his learning beyond the classroom,
Kieran offered Geopolitics: Geographies of War and Peace at the H3 level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond his many academic achievements, Kieran actively pursued opportunities
to develop his interests and serve the community. He put his love for making
meaningful connections to good use as an Orientation Group Leader (OGL)
for the 2023 JC1 Orientation and invested much effort into making his incoming
juniors feel welcome in the college. In addition to being an OGL, Kieran
was also chosen to be a faction head which required him to take charge
of the coordination of his fellow OGLs.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Koh Bevan</strong></h4>
<p>Bevan is an independent and self-directed learner who demonstrates drive
and purpose. As a student, he read extensively to broaden his intellectual
horizons. He used his knowledge meaningfully to enrich class discussions,
mentor his classmates and to buttress his arguments in essays. Due to his
admirable work ethic, Bevan was able to keep up with the rigorous demands
of the A-Level curriculum. Bevan also pursued opportunities to extend his
learning beyond the classroom. He was a participant in the Junior College
Law Programme (JCLP) where he learned about the complexities of the legal
profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a student in the Ignite programme, Bevan embarked on a service learning
project with his classmates to promote the importance of cultivating and
consuming locally grown vegetables as a sustainable food source. Bevan
demonstrated exemplary work ethic during this project: he oversaw the planning
and the setting up of an exhibition in school. Bevan and his classmates
hoped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainability, and to inspire
his schoolmates to make choices that benefit the environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bevan was selected from his English Language and Linguistics (ELL) class
to be a moderator at the CJC-NJC (National Junior College) ELL Symposium
which was graced by esteemed academics and guests from the National University
of Singapore and other schools. Bevan worked hard to prepare for this rare
opportunity to facilitate the discussions between the speakers and the
audience. Quick-witted and adaptable, he was able to think on his feet
and improvise solutions to technical difficulties when they arose.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Yang Liquan Adam</strong></h4>
<p>Adam was a participant in the Ignite programme, the college's interdisciplinary
stretch programme for academically talented students. A dedicated and passionate
learner, he constantly sought opportunities to broaden his understanding
of global issues, and sharpen his critical thinking skills. For example,
he participated actively in events such as the annual Ignite conference,
the National Education Symposium, and the History Pre-University Seminar.
He also participated in CJC’s Model United Nations Conference where he
was conferred the Outstanding Delegate award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam was a recipient of the college's prestigious Flame Scholarship that
recognised his leadership capabilities and outstanding contributions to
his Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), Strategy Games Club. He was elected the
President of the Strategy Games Club due to his passion for mentoring and
nurturing others. During moments of disagreement among the executive committee,
Adam showed maturity in mediating these situations, further strengthening
his leadership skills. He instilled confidence in his team members by encouraging
them whenever they encountered obstacles, and was an ever-present source
of help to them. In 2022, Adam represented the college at Hwa Chong Institution's
Bridge Cup.</p>
<h4><strong>Deirdre Phua Yi Ting</strong></h4>
<p>Deirdre's empathy for others served her well in her role as the Home Tutorial
Councillor (HTC) of her class. A natural leader who exudes warmth and sincerity,
Deirdre was well-liked by her classmates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always attracted to the power and beauty of the Arts, Deirdre joined Drama
as her Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in college. While learning new skills
as a fledgling thespian was challenging, she made the most of her time
in the CCA by absorbing important lessons from her instructor and peers.
Deirdre worked effectively with her peers to put up an engaging performance
at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2022 where they
attained a Certificate of Distinction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an English Literature and English Language and Linguistics (ELL) student,
Deirdre derived great joy from learning about the intricacies and mechanics
of the English language. She participated in the Creative Arts Program,
the English Language and Linguistics Symposium, Litera and the Literature
Stretch Programme; Deirdre was also selected to attend the Singapore Perspectives
Conference and was attached to the National Council of Social Services
for an internship which was a requirement of the English Language Elective
Scholarship (ELES) that Deirdre was a recipient of.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Siti Sarah Binte Muhammad Burhan</strong></h4>
<p>Diligent and conscientious, Sarah set high standards for herself, and
worked tirelessly towards achieving them. She listened attentively during
lessons, applied feedback thoughtfully, and offered intelligent ideas during
class discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Vice-President of the Student Council and Head of the Community
Involvement Wing, Sarah demonstrated a strong sense of duty, and commendable
leadership skills. She was involved in the planning and execution of important
school events such as Open House, CCA Bazaar and Leaders’ Dialogue. Sarah
