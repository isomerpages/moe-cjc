<p></p>

</div>
<p>Wan Fei is an exemplary individual who demonstrates self-discipline and
resilience. Wan Fei overcame many personal obstacles throughout her journey
to achieving academic success at the A-Level examinations. She has a medical
condition which impedes her mobility; however, she remained steadfast in
her commitment to academic excellence, making her an inspiration to her
peers and tutors. Wan Fei possesses maturity of thought, criticality and
a keen sensitivity to language — dispositions that stood her in good stead
as a student in the arts faculty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond her academic commitments, Wan Fei was actively involved in the
Nexus Investment and Entrepreneurship Society, her co-curricular activity
(CCA). Her participation in this CCA provided her with a platform to express
her passion for financial literacy, business, and entrepreneurship. Despite
not holding an official leadership role, Wan Fei made significant contributions
to various college events. Wan Fei took an active role in events like the
CCA Open House and CCA Bazaar, which enabled her to hone her communication
skills and master the art of effective pitching. Stepping out of her comfort
zone, she assumed the role of a facilitator during the CJC Nexus Experience
Day. In addition, participating in CCA-related competitions, including
the CJC Nexus FinLit Week in 2023, offered Wan Fei insights into leadership
responsibilities. She coordinated logistics, motivated team members, and
ensured project deadlines were met.</p>
<h4>Tay Hui Xin Sharon</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/75_CCS_7435.jpg">
</div>
<p>Sharon demonstrated strong leadership abilities throughout her college
journey. As the House Captain of Joseph House, she guided and mentored
a team of sports leaders under her charge. Kind and nurturing, Sharon was
an exemplary role model to her peers who often looked to her for advice.
She played a pivotal role in planning significant college events such as
Open House, Cross Country and the Sports and Aesthetics Carnival. Sharon
honed her leadership skills through her participation in the 2022 JC1 Leadership
Training Camp and JC1 Leaders' Dialogue. As a testament to her capable
leadership, she was selected as one of the few JC2 facilitators at the
Leadership Training Camp in 2023 where she imparted her wisdom to her juniors.
Sharon’s time as a House Captain helped her develop confidence, resilience
and empathy.</p>
<p>Despite being involved in multiple leadership commitments, Sharon was
active in the Choir, her co-curricular activity (CCA). As a former member
of her primary school and secondary school choirs, Sharon joined CJC's
Choir with a strong foundation. She took on the role of Section Leader,
effectively guiding and leading members of her choir section. However,
the transition proved to be a new challenge as the Choir CCA was notably
smaller in size compared to the choirs she used to be involved in. This
shift necessitated a heightened level of accountability for each member
which was stressful at times, but also rewarding and character defining.
Sharon motivated her fellow choir members, and they worked together to
achieve a Certificate of Distinction for the college at the Singapore Youth
Festival Arts Presentation 2023.</p>
<h4>Wong Jian Cheng, Herman</h4>
<p></p>

organised by the College where he learnt about sustainability and development
in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Vice President of Publicity for his co-curricular activity (CCA),

for managing Nexus’ publicity efforts which include running an Instagram
account and promoting events organised by Nexus. He collaborated effectively
