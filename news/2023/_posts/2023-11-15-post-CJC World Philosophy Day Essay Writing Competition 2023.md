*Organized in celebration of World Philosophy Day, 16th November 2023*                                                                      

The contemporary philosopher, Anthony Grayling, believes that philosophy should play a useful role in society and public policy (not just in academia).   

A philosophy essay by its very nature involves critical thinking, logical reasoning and conceptual analysis skills – as critical thinking and rational argumentation are characteristic methods of philosophical inquiry and analysis. 


Write an essay in response to ONE of the following questions:

1. ‘The world is becoming less of a global village and more of a tribal jungle.’ Critically assess this viewpoint.
2. Consider the view that ‘We need to move more aggressively to a metropolis based on buses and bikes.’
3. Given our addiction to digital devices, ‘We are not looking, not thinking; we are walking around in some kind of fog, in a trance, like zombies.’ Comment.   
4. To what extent is one’s thought determined by one’s milieu?
5. ‘We will gain power over our fates.’ Wishful thinking or a plausible prospect? 

Guidelines and requirements for writing your Philosophy Essay:  
* Length of Essay: At least 800 to 1500 words (feel free to exceed if need be);
* Your essay is an argumentative defense of your adopted Thesis – in which the central claim is clearly stated, explained and analyzed; arguments are rationally presented in support of the thesis; possible objections (counter-arguments) are fairly considered, objectively evaluated, and rationally refuted.

Your philosophical essay thus has five component parts:

1. The effective formulation of a Thesis – stated clearly in the introduction;                                           
2. Arguments (reasons and evidence) set out in support and defense of Thesis;
3. Careful critical consideration and evaluation of counter-arguments and counter-examples (objections to Thesis); 
4. Refutation of Counter-Arguments i.e. Replies to challenging Objections; 
5. Effective Conclusion – final thoughts / closing remarks;
 
NOTE: Include, where appropriate, possible creative solutions.
