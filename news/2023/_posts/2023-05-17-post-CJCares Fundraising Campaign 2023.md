Dear Parents/Guardians,

CJC will be holding our annual Sports and Aesthetics Carnival on 26 May 2023 and CJCelebrates Concert on 31 May 2023 to develop and showcase the talents of our students and enable all CJCians to come together as one CJ community to end Term 2 in an uplifting way after completing Part 1 of the Mid-Year Examination(MYE).

As part of our culture of care, the Sports and Aesthetics Carnival and CJ Celebrates Concert &nbsp;will raise funds for the CJCares Fundraising Campaign to support CJCians who require financial assistance during these challenging times. The CJCares Fundraising Campaign has been ongoing since 5 August 2021 and will end on 30 June 2023. We would like to appeal to all parents to donate generously through the Giving.sg portal at [https://www.giving.sg/organisation/profile/961a755e-ec67-417c-94a8-a3d28089dc5c](https://www.giving.sg/organisation/profile/961a755e-ec67-417c-94a8-a3d28089dc5c). Alternatively, donors may send a crossed cheque (with name, contact details and “CJCares Fundraising Campaign” at the back of the cheque) to Catholic Junior College at 129 Whitley Road, Singapore 297822. Donations of $50 and above will be tax-exempt.*
