The sudden downpour on the morning of 26 May failed to dampen spirits for CJCians who have been looking forward to Catholic Junior Collegeâ€™s (CJC) annual Sports and Aesthetics Carnival. Mrs Phyllis Lim, CJC Principal, delivered an inspiring speech, commending the sports leaders (SLs) for their swift response to the inclement weather. Everyone was energised by the lively dance performances put up by the SLs as a rousing start to a day of camaraderie and the building of collegial and house spirit among CJCians.

Students dressed in their house shirts were a vibrant sight of red, orange, yellow, and green as they made their way to different indoor and outdoor venues as the skies cleared. Teams competing in netball and basketball went to the sheltered courts, while floorball was held at the Piazza. Activities requiring creativity and aesthetic elements, such as the Escape Room and mascot design, were hosted at the Performing Arts Centre (PAC) and the foyer. Participants immersed themselves in the activities, demonstrating great sportsmanship and teamwork.

After the games concluded, the college community gathered at the grandstand for another exhilarating dance performance by the four houses, allowing the SLs and students to captivate everyone with their nifty moves. Albert House kicked off the dance sequence with their energetic performance, followed by Joseph House, Patrick House, and Michael House. This culminated in a dance where all Houses moved in synchrony. Patrick House was crowned the winning House, followed by Michael, Joseph, and Albert Houses. The Sports and Aesthetics Carnival was brought to a memorable close and ended Term 2 on a high note for CJCians.
