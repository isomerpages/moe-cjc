Catholic Junior College’s (CJC) signature rock concert, Rockafella XVII, was held on 28 April to a full house. Rockafella is a much-beloved music fest that students look forward to and it is held annually on the last day of CJC's Mental Wellness Week. Put together by CJC’s own talents of student and teacher bands, this year's edition witnessed an auditorium full of rapturous cheers and applause for friends and teachers who performed on stage.

The concert opened with a solo performance, followed by student performers competing to win the audience's hearts. To make the evening even more exciting, a group of dancers showcased their impressive moves and the emcees masterfully engaged the audience in interactive activities. A special performance by members of the CJC alumni who returned to perform for the college delighted the crowd and brought a wave of nostalgia for performers and everyone present.
