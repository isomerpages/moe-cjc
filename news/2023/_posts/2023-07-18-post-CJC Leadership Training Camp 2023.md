Catholic Junior College held the "Build The Light'' transformative Leadership Training Camp (LTC), spanning two days and one night from May 26th to May 27th. Newly elected JC1 Organisational Leaders were participants of this camp, where they were given opportunities to empower them as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart (TMLH). Participants were organised into groups, strengthening networks and forging stronger bonds with their peers.

The LTC’s lessons on discipline, resilience and collaboration were imbued in its participants as they began the day with an impromptu fire drill that jolted participants from their slumber and hastened their assembly at the designated area at 5.30am. Participants then gathered at the canteen for a hearty breakfast before commencing the Amazing Race. They unlocked each subsequent location by solving a clue, ultimately leading them to the enchanting Singapore Quarry. Throughout the day, a sense of camaraderie flourished as groups navigated their way to each destination, making collective decisions, communicating effectively, and honing their problem-solving skills. A bevy of activities at the Botanic Gardens presented a diverse range of challenges, allowing a chance for the JC1 student leaders to display their TMLH attributes – Integrity, Discernment, Resilience, Initiative, Humility, Purpose and Nurturing.

The Passing of the Flame marked the end of the camp, and a solid foundation had been laid for the JC1 Organisational Leaders. Equipped with the 7 TMLH attributes, they are poised to effect positive change within the school community and beyond.
