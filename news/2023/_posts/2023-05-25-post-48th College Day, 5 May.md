The Guest of Honour, Mr Freddie Yeo, from the Class of 1987, who is currently the Chief Operating Officer of Infinite Studios, shared important lessons he learnt from his time in CJC, and the values he holds dear to him: passion, attitude, humility, respect, integrity, and empathy. He also spoke about how the Catholic faith has remained a guiding light for him even until today.

Next, the College Chaplain, Father Justin Yip, led the prayer service, reminding everyone gathered that with God’s love and grace, we can get through any challenges as a College. He also exhorted the CJ community to be salt and light for the world.

The College came together to commend all award winners for their diligence and to celebrate their achievements. Notably, the recipient of the prestigious Dr Ee Peng Liang Memorial Award, Olivia Tan (Class of 2022), was recognised for her academic achievements and contributions to the College as well as the larger community.
