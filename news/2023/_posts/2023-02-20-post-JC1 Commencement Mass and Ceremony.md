On 20 February, Catholic Junior College (CJC) officially welcomed the new JC1s with the Commencement Mass and Ceremony. This event was significant as it was the first ceremony involving both the JC1s and JC2s since the pandemic, and the auditorium was buzzing with excitement. Earlier in the morning, the seniors facilitated some icebreaker games and interactive activities to connect with their juniors, bringing about a lot of laughter and extending the culture of care to the new CJCians.

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal, started the day's proceedings by encouraging the JC1s to get to know their classmates, CCA mates and other peers, and to seize opportunities to learn and grow by adopting a growth mindset. Mrs Lim also affirmed the hard work put in by the 48th Student Council in building a vibrant and dynamic student life. In addition, she spoke on various improvements to infrastructure and services in the campus such as the new study areas and cashless payment in the canteen.

Monsignor (Msgr) Ambrose Vaz presided over mass with our College Chaplain, Father Justin Yip. The entrance hymn, “All are welcome”, invited students to build an inclusive community of love and compassion. Following mass, Msgr Vaz blessed the college pins that are traditionally pinned onto the collars of each JC1 student by a JC2 student. This symbolic act officially marked them as CJCians, called to live by the values the flame symbolises – love, sacrifice and truth. The JC1s received their pins with pride and reverence, happy at being welcomed with such a meaningful gesture.

For the first time in years since the pandemic, the Commencement Mass and Ceremony brought all the staff and students together. With hearts full of thanksgiving and joy, it truly was a good start to the year.
