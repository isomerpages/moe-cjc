The Class of 2022 achieved commendable results at the 2022 GCE A-Level examinations and did themselves and the College proud. Catholic Junior College (CJC) maintained its strong value-added performance with good distinction rates across the different A-Level subjects. The school is delighted to have many CJCians realise their aspirations and qualify for reputable local and overseas institutes of higher learning.

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, commended the Class of 2022 for their results and said, “you picked up the pace and seized opportunities to embrace full learning activities once the easing of Safe Management Measures took effect. Despite challenges, you displayed resilience, innovation, and drive to embrace learning with a growth mindset and achieve outstanding results. May you continue to lead and serve as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.”  

Mrs Poon Wai Chin, Vice-Principal/Academic added, “our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2022 on your good results! The many pathways that lie ahead are yours to explore. Hold fast to your dreams and aspirations, while keeping an open mind as you progress in your learning and broaden your experiences. May you demonstrate your passion in all that you do and may the spirit of continuous learning enable you to seize new opportunities and face future challenges with courage and verve.”

The College extends its deepest appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee (SMC) and the alumni for their dedicated support for our CJCians. May God continue to bless our Class of 2022 with grace and wisdom as they take flight as thinkers and leaders who will make a positive impact on society.

The College celebrates the outstanding achievements of the following CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart.

"_Don’t wait until it’s too late before meeting your teachers for consultations. Start early! Listen in class and pay attention to what your teachers say. Learn from your friends too. Don’t disregard the small conversations in class with your teachers and friends because that’s when a lot of ideas are imparted or exchanged._"

Over two days, Gwyneth took on the perspective of a Southeast Asian country and participated in lively virtual discussions with fellow CJC students and their Vietnamese counterparts on the topic of COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) in the region. This experience sparked her interest in such programmes, and she went on to participate in CJC Model United Nations (MUN) in 2022, clinching the Outstanding Delegate Award.

His efforts paid off when he was chosen to represent the college at the National School Games Tennis Championships ‘A’ Division Boys in 2022. 

Furthermore, Keene exhibited a strong sense of initiative by stepping up to serve the class as the Subject Representative for Economics. He also went beyond his role to help manage class finances for the subject and served the class well by giving presentations to his class during the College’s Economics Week in 2021. He stepped up to become the Publicity Manager for Economics Week in 2022 where he collaborated with his schoolmates to design posters and film promotional videos for the event.

"_I would like to thank my teachers and my friends for helping me with my studies, because without them, I wouldn't have achieved this result. They were my only source of help, so they really played a huge part in helping me. To the juniors, find your group of friends who is positive, who would help and support you. Find like-minded people who share your vision in doing well for the A-Levels._"

##### **Tang Zheng Jia Loong Ethan Nicholas**
<img src="/images/classof20227.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Ethan is a conscientious and self-motivated student who constantly sought to improve in his studies throughout his time in CJC. He managed his time well and was an independent learner. He was able to voice his opinions or clarify his doubts in class to facilitate his own learning and thus benefited others in the process. He did well in Project Work, for which he scored a distinction at the GCE A-Level examination in November 2021. Ethan also did well in his science subjects, namely, Chemistry and Biology.

She displays a marked ability to competently engage with subjects that demand both literacy and numeracy with equal ease. Her most favourite area of academic inquiry is General Paper, given its focus on global issues, and its engagement with philosophical ideas.

"_I found the environment in CJ very conducive which helped me to excel. The teachers put in a lot of effort and gave us many interesting and unique perspectives which are important for subjects like Literature and General Paper. My friends were also very supportive, and we helped one another. One of the memorable programmes I attended in CJ is Litera which helped me discover the fun side of studying Literature._"

Notably, she led the organisation of the college's Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) Bazaar, which showcased the various CCAs and college spirit to the freshly-inducted JC1 students.

**Janice Low Yee Teng, Asst Home Tutorial Councillor, 2T05, STE2M Club Exco**<br>
"_CJ really helped with my personal growth not just as a leader but as an individual. I had many opportunities to voice my opinions and explore. Participation in programmes like OSLP, LSLP and competitions in my CCA, STE2M Club, gave me a chance to forge new friendships and contributed to my personal growth as I got to learn communications and organisational skills. I became more self-directed and resilient._"  
  
**Sze Kenneth Owen, 2T09, Film, Sound and Video Society President**<br>
"_The various leadership training camps in CJ made me realise how important being a leader is and guided me in my journey in becoming a leader. For me, perseverance is the number one quality to push through challenges in life. I think it is very important to never give up._"  
  
**Nicole Lim Jia Hui, 2T03, Strategy Games Club President**<br>
"_The little actions that you do can make a difference - such as being there for the people around you and building bonds with your classmates and your friends. My friends and I are always there for each other._"  
  
**Ignatius Chia Ming Han, 2T28, Badminton Captain, Genesis President**<br>
"_Always aim for the best. Have a goal in mind so that it will motivate you to study harder._"  
  
**Tan Yee Fei, 2T04, Home Tutorial Councillor, Oratorical Society Exco, Ultimate Exco**<br>
"_Home Class culture – sharing a common mindset in doing well and setting good standards for ourselves – was an attribute that created the right learning environment for me. I am also grateful for my teachers, who kept pushing us to strive for better, giving us the assurance that they are on the journey with us._"

**Lim Qian Ru, Clarabelle, 2T21, Flame Scholar, Pastoral Care Councillor, Netball Captain**<br>
"_Resilience is important in academic achievement. Keep going and putting in the same amount of effort. Consistency will get you ahead._"
