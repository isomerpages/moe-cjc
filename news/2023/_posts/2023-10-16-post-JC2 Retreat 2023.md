The college resumed its 2D1N JC2 Retreat this year, the first since the pandemic struck. From 29 to 30 Sep, about 60 JC2 participants - comprising Catholic and non-Catholic students - experienced a time of prayer and fellowship, reconnecting with God after a hectic year.

The highlight of the Retreat was, as always, the Labyrinth walk - a walking meditation in a beautiful setting that was lovingly constructed by CJC teachers, alumni, and even JC1 students who stepped up to help!

Reflection stations were also set up in the library for retreatants to watch a short film and engage with hands-on activities such as origami, letter writing and prayer through poems and short stories.

We also want to thank the Office for Young People (OYP) for coming down to facilitate the saturday programme, which included praise and worship, input, and prayer. Many OYP facilitators are CJ alumni, and it was lovely to welcome them home!

We hope that all participants were blessed by the Retreat experience, and for even more to join us in the years to come!
