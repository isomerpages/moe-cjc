Congratulations to Gwyneth Tan (2T05, Class of 2022) for receiving the Merit Award for the 2023 Edwin Thumboo Prize. The prestigious prize, awarded by NUS Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, recognises only three pre-university students annually for excellence in literary work.  
 
Gwyneth's wonderful essay explored, at length, the presentation of temporality in shaping selfhood in James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Her achievement is testament to her intellectual rigour and love for Literature, a true inspiration to her juniors. Well done!
