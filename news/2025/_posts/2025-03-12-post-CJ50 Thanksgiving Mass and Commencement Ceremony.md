<p>The annual Commencement Ceremony signifies the start of a new year – a
chance for us to officially welcome the new JC1 students into the college.&nbsp;
It was extra special this year as it was held&nbsp; with our 50th Anniversary
Thanksgiving Mass commemorating “A Family United in Truth and Love”. Former
CJC Principals, alumni priests, and members of our School Management Committee
and Family@CJ Parent Support Group came together as a family to thank God
for His abundant graces over the past 50 years and prayed for His continued
providence in the coming school year and beyond.</p>

<p>His Eminence, Cardinal William Goh celebrated the mass and graced the
occasion. The mass was a significant start to the school year and a fitting
celebration for such a momentous occasion. The mass was filled with uplifting
hymns and messages of hope, focusing on the enduring values of faith, service,
and excellence that the college has upheld since its founding. Cardinal
Goh’s homily was special as he shared how living out our motto “In Veritate
Et Caritate”- in Truth and Love - builds a stronger community, both within
and beyond our college walls. This is the foundation on which our college
has stood for for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With prayers for divine grace and protection, His Eminence then blessed
the new Heritage Gallery and Student Recreation Centre – affirming and
celebrating both our past, and our dedication to growth and new beginnings.
(All members of the CJ family are welcome to come and recollect and reminisce
about our shared history during one of our upcoming CJ50 events.)</p>

<p>With the close of the mass and benediction blessing, we came to another
memorable event – as aptly quipped by Sophie O’ Hara, President of the
50th Student Council, “What’s a birthday celebration without cake?”. His
Eminence, Principal Mrs Woo Soo Min, College Chaplain Rev Fr Shaun Lim,
former CJC Principals, and past and present members of the School Management
Committee cut a birthday cake – offered generously by CJC alumnus, John
Yap, founder of Awfully Chocolate – as the auditorium sang Happy Birthday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a cherished tradition, the new JC1 students received their college
pin from the current JC2 students, signifying the passing of CJC’s flame
from senior to junior, marking a poignant transfer of CJC's heritage and
aspirations.</p>

<p>A reception was held at the end of the ceremony, bringing the college
community together in fellowship and celebration. The canteen was abuzz
with enthusiastic reunions and some students had the chance for an informal
engagement session with His Eminence, Cardinal Goh. He encouraged them
to continue to build themselves and the community, emphasising that young
people must find their place in life and live with enthusiasm and dedication.
Their candid exchanges reflected the genuine warmth and camaraderie that
defines the college spirit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This meaningful celebration set the perfect tone for our golden jubilee
year - a harmonious blend of tradition and renewal, gratitude and aspiration.
As the college embarks on this milestone year of festivities, the warmth
and unity displayed at the Commencement Ceremony echoed the very essence
of what it means to be part of the CJ family: a community bound together
by Truth and Love, honouring its past while embracing its future with hope.</p>
