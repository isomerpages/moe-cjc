<p>The Catholic Junior College (CJC) community is saddened by the news of
the passing of His Holiness, Pope Francis today. We fondly remember how
His Holiness connected with youths and CJCians during the Interreligious
Youth with Pope Francis last year.</p>
<p>We are blessed to have Pope Francis share his wisdom with us on the importance
of building deeper understanding with our fellow brothers and sisters regardless
of religion and race.</p>
<p>Eternal rest grant unto Pope Francis, O Lord, and let perpetual light
shine upon him. May his soul and all the souls of the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
