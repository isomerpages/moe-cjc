<p>“From Breaking News to Viral Views: How the Language of Online Media Shapes
our World” - On 25 April 2025, the annual English Language and Linguistics
(ELL) Symposium was held at Catholic Junior College (CJC), jointly organised
by CJC and National Junior College (NJC). The insightful sharing of the
three invited speakers enraptured the three hundred odd attendees, which
included enthusiastic and passionate ELL students from five junior colleges,
as well as selected secondary school students who were eager to learn more
about this subject. The stage was set for Associate Professor Csilla Weninger,
Associate Professor at National Institute of Education, as well as Assistant
Professor Luke Lu, and to end off, Ms Amanda Chai – a lifestyle journalist
at local news company <em>The Straits Times</em>. They enthralled the audience
as they shared their breadth of knowledge on the multiple ways in which
the language of online media shapes our world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lectures delved into a wide spectrum of thought-provoking topics,
ranging from discerning real versus fake news, to the ‘enregisterment’
of Singlish in the digital realm, and even how to write trendy yet credible
articles for mainstream media. Associate Professor Csilla Weninger began
by analysing the tell-tale signs of misinformation, contrasting the density
and factual integrity of real news with the manipulative intent often found
in fake news. She introduced the concept of ‘platformization’, explaining
how social media platforms amplify content and encase users in algorithm-driven
echo chambers, which reinforce personal biases and fuel the viral spread
of misinformation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assistant Professor Luke Lu followed with a deep dive into the digital
journey of Singlish, illustrating how words like “kiasu” have adopted fixed
spellings while others remain fluid, reflecting the ever-evolving nature
of language. He also emphasised how the globalisation of Singlish—now recognised
in the Oxford English Dictionary—speaks to the influence of Singapore’s
linguistic identity in online spaces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Concluding the lineup was Ms Amanda Chai, a Style Correspondent at <em>The Straits Times</em>,
who offered a refreshing, journalistic lens on language. She discussed
the importance of balancing conversational tone with authoritative credibility
in modern reporting, and addressed the challenges of engaging multi-generational
audiences amidst shrinking attention spans. By leveraging platforms like
Instagram and TikTok and incorporating multimedia elements, she revealed
how traditional media is innovating to remain relevant—reminding students
that stories worth telling often begin with even the smallest, overlooked
trends.</p>

<p>After the enlightening and informative talks, students gathered their
questions and directed them at speakers during an engaging Q&amp;A session,
in which they bravely stepped forward to clarify their doubts and posed
thoughtful and incisive questions, demonstrating not only a keen interest
in the subject matter but also a commendable effort to think critically.
The Q&amp;A session heralded the end of the 2025 ELL Symposium but the
beginning of new learning and insight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the panel discussion, students attended the tea reception, where
the atmosphere buzzed with excitement as students from the different institutions
mingled freely, united by a shared passion for the English language. This
setting offered more than just a feast for the palate—it became a vibrant
space for exchanging ideas, reflections, and newfound perspectives sparked
by the symposium. It was a moment where budding linguists, aspiring journalists,
and language enthusiasts alike found common ground, forming connections
that transcended beyond our different schools and backgrounds.</p>
<p>When asked for her experience, Eva Noblezada from ACJC reflected that
“I learnt that the digital age has led to language evolving more rapidly
and that language use is directly impacted by the new needs and goals of
the digital age, such as how monetization on online platforms have led
to an increase in tabloid-like misleading stories and headlines in order
to generate controversy and attention.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isaiah Chua Cheng Xi from CJC reflected “In just three hours, I uncovered
three entire universes — one about language online, one about Singlish,
and one about how we write ‘news’ … It also fascinated me that the increased
use of emphatics and pronouns drives fake news to spread 7 times faster
than real news. Such an important point to note in today’s digital age!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the symposium undoubtedly expanded our knowledge on the critical
role which language plays in online media to shape our world. Students
were able to leave with a deeper understanding and appreciation of the
English Language.</p>
