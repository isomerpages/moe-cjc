<p>On 25 November, our JC1 students gathered at the Performing Arts Centre
for the End-of-Year Thanksgiving Ceremony—a meaningful pause to reflect
on the blessings of 2025 and look ahead with hope.</p>

<p>At the heart of the ceremony were the reflection letters—personal notes
penned by each JC1 student during their morning SD lesson. These letters
captured individual journeys of growth and aspirations for the year ahead,
marking an important milestone in their CJC Story.</p>

<p>The ceremony saw the presentation of awards, recognising students who
have demonstrated outstanding dedication and growth throughout the year.
These moments of celebration reminded us of the hard work and perseverance
that define the CJC spirit.</p>

<p>Our Gratitude Tree stood as a beautiful symbol of our community's collective
thankfulness. Adorned with leaf-shaped notes from students and staff alike,
each leaf carried expressions of gratitude for 2025 and hopes for contributing
to the good of the CJC family in 2026.</p>

<p>The ceremony also served as a special farewell to Dr Thiru and Mr Peter
Thia, who have dedicated many years of service to CJC. Through heartfelt
tributes and scrapbooks filled with messages from the community, we honoured
their lasting impact on generations of CJCians.</p>
