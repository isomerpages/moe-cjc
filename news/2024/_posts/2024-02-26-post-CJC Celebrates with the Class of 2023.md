which bear testimony to their hard work, grit, and commitment, as well
as the support and help from their teachers. As a cohort whose educational
experience had been affected by the uncertainties brought on by the COVID-19
pandemic, CJCians have emerged stronger in character and with clarity of
purpose. Formed as Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart, they
are well placed to venture out to pursue their passion in the next chapter
of their lives, be it in higher education or in discerning their vocation.
Congratulations to all!”</p>
<p>Lauding the Class of 2023, Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal (Student Development)
added, “The future holds many exciting possibilities for you. I encourage
you to cherish all that you have learned, to be passionate in all that
you do, and to continue making meaningful connections with all whom you
meet. I am confident that you will continue to shine brightly and serve
as an inspiration to future CJCians. Not only have you done well, you have
also contributed to the legacy of the CJC community.”</p>

wishes to the Class of 2023. “Congratulations on reaching this milestone
in your academic pursuit! Today marks yet another start towards the next
lap of your journey of chasing your dreams. Remember your personal mission
and where your passion drives you towards, and also be cognisant of the
community around you. Remember that the true calling of a CJCian is to
make a difference in the lives of others around us. Wishing you all the
best in your future endeavours!”</p>

<h4>Tan Wan Fei</h4>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>Wan Fei is an exemplary individual who demonstrates self-discipline and
resilience. Wan Fei overcame many personal obstacles throughout her journey
to achieving academic success at the A-Level examinations. She has a medical
condition which impedes her mobility; however, she remained steadfast in
her commitment to academic excellence, making her an inspiration to her
peers and tutors. Wan Fei possesses maturity of thought, criticality and
a keen sensitivity to language — dispositions that stood her in good stead
as a student in the arts faculty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond her academic commitments, Wan Fei was actively involved in the
Nexus Investment and Entrepreneurship Society, her co-curricular activity
(CCA). Her participation in this CCA provided her with a platform to express
her passion for financial literacy, business, and entrepreneurship. Despite
not holding an official leadership role, Wan Fei made significant contributions
to various college events. Wan Fei took an active role in events like the
CCA Open House and CCA Bazaar, which enabled her to hone her communication
skills and master the art of effective pitching. Stepping out of her comfort
zone, she assumed the role of a facilitator during the CJC Nexus Experience
Day. In addition, participating in CCA-related competitions, including
the CJC Nexus FinLit Week in 2023, offered Wan Fei insights into leadership
responsibilities. She coordinated logistics, motivated team members, and
ensured project deadlines were met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I would like to thank my family and friends as they provided the unwavering emotional support that I needed when I was going through the tough A-Level journey. I would also like to thank my teachers for being very accommodating and understanding, and for providing me with the support I needed to do my best at the A-Level examinations, such as taking the time from their busy schedules to have consultations with me and my friends to address our queries.</em>
</p>

<h4>Tay Hui Xin Sharon</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/75_CCS_7435.jpg">
</div>
<p>Sharon demonstrated strong leadership abilities throughout her college
journey. As the House Captain of Joseph House, she guided and mentored
a team of sports leaders under her charge. Kind and nurturing, Sharon was
an exemplary role model to her peers who often looked to her for advice.
She played a pivotal role in planning significant college events such as
Open House, Cross Country and the Sports and Aesthetics Carnival. Sharon
honed her leadership skills through her participation in the 2022 JC1 Leadership
Training Camp and JC1 Leaders' Dialogue. As a testament to her capable
leadership, she was selected as one of the few JC2 facilitators at the
Leadership Training Camp in 2023 where she imparted her wisdom to her juniors.
Sharon’s time as a House Captain helped her develop confidence, resilience
and empathy.</p>
<p>Despite being involved in multiple leadership commitments, Sharon was
active in the Choir, her co-curricular activity (CCA). As a former member
of her primary school and secondary school choirs, Sharon joined CJC's
Choir with a strong foundation. She took on the role of Section Leader,
effectively guiding and leading members of her choir section. However,
the transition proved to be a new challenge as the Choir CCA was notably
smaller in size compared to the choirs she used to be involved in. This
shift necessitated a heightened level of accountability for each member
which was stressful at times, but also rewarding and character defining.
Sharon motivated her fellow choir members, and they worked together to
achieve a Certificate of Distinction for the college at the Singapore Youth
Festival Arts Presentation 2023.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My role as a House Captain forced me out of my comfort zone in ways that have moulded me into a more confident presenter. Overall, I believe my experiences have shaped me to be an individual who values sincerity and dedication, who understands the need to lead through service, and who believes firmly that persistent hard work to improve oneself will always pay off.</em>

</div>
<p>Herman is a keen and intellectually curious learner. During his time in
Catholic Junior College, Herman demonstrated excellence in his academic
endeavours. He set high standards for himself, and worked relentlessly
towards achieving them. Herman was generous with sharing his knowledge
with his peers; for example, Herman took up the role of a StellarNova mentor
which involved guiding a peer in one of his strongest subjects, Geography.
Herman also went the extra mile to pursue learning beyond the prescribed
A-Level curriculum: He participated in the 34th Chemistry Olympiad, and
was also a participant in the Economics and General Paper Stretch Programme
organised by the College where he learnt about sustainability and development
in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Vice President of Publicity for his co-curricular activity (CCA),
the Nexus Entrepreneurship and Investment Society, Herman demonstrated
resourcefulness, dedication and servant leadership. He led a team responsible
for managing Nexus’ publicity efforts which include running an Instagram
account and promoting events organised by Nexus. He collaborated effectively
with his peers to plan and facilitate schoolwide events such as BizWeek;
in addition, he also took up the challenge of being a presenter during
those events to educate his schoolmates on financial literacy.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As the Head of Publicity of the Nexus CCA, I had to collaborate and connect with a large number of people. My time in Nexus has helped me develop both soft and hard skills, and I will forever be grateful for such an opportunity.</em>

</div>
<p>Odelia’s remarkable work ethic and resilience made her an exceptional
student. Odelia was highly invested in her studies; she often went the
extra mile to clarify her doubts with her subject tutors, and also put
in consistent effort to revise for her academic subjects. During her time
in CJC, Odelia was given the opportunity to participate in the Academic
Immersion Programme with Tran Phu High School from Vietnam. As part of
this programme, Odelia took on the responsibility of planning and teaching
lessons to CJC students about the similarities and differences between
Vietnam’s and Singapore's green plans. Odelia's academic achievements and
active engagement in cross-cultural learning exemplify her dedication to
personal growth and academic exploration.</p>
<p>As a Student Councillor in the Catholic Activities Wing, Odelia was driven
by a strong desire to serve God, and to serve her peers; she truly embodied
what it means to be a “leader with a heart.” Odelia, along with her peers
in the Catholic Activities Wing, helped strengthen the College’s Catholic
ethos; for example, she was involved in planning the College’s Easter Celebration
event—a role she performed with great aplomb. She was also involved in
weekly Friday masses and Lenten Evening. Her faith kept her afloat in trying
times; it is truly a testament to both her tenacity as well as her exceptional
leadership qualities that she was offered the CJC Flame Scholarship.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Catholic programmes and events that CJC regularly organised throughout my two years gave me access to a supportive and close-knit community, which is something I am immensely grateful for. Not only did the family-like nature of the community allow me to form long-lasting friendships; this community was also one of my strongest pillars of support during my time in CJC, especially during the A-Level preparation period. One particularly impactful event which I attended was our College’s Lenten Evening where I learnt the importance of having faith during difficult times.</em>

<h4>Kieran Chang</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/76_CCS_7438.jpg">
</div>
<p>Kieran is a mature and diligent individual who shows genuine curiosity
about the world around him. He attained numerous academic achievements
during his time in CJC, and this can be attributed to his dedication, consistency
and thirst for knowledge. Kieran was recognised as the Top Arts Student&nbsp;
when he was a JC1 student and was on the Principal's Honour Roll for multiple
assessments. He topped his cohort for H2 Economics, H2 Geography and H1
History in these assessments. To extend his learning beyond the classroom,
Kieran offered Geopolitics: Geographies of War and Peace at the H3 level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond his many academic achievements, Kieran actively pursued opportunities
to develop his interests and serve the community. He put his love for making
meaningful connections to good use as an Orientation Group Leader (OGL)
for the 2023 JC1 Orientation and invested much effort into making his incoming
juniors feel welcome in the college. In addition to being an OGL, Kieran
was also chosen to be a faction head which required him to take charge
of the coordination of his fellow OGLs.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I enjoyed the bonding I experienced with my fellow Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) since we had to work together in order to carry out a successful Orientation programme. We had to put aside our differences and utilise each of our strengths. I also enjoyed interacting with the incoming J1s as I got the opportunity to learn about each of them beyond a superficial level.</em>

<h4>Koh Bevan</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/83_CCS_7454.jpg">
</div>
<p>Bevan is an independent and self-directed learner who demonstrates drive
and purpose. As a student, he read extensively to broaden his intellectual
horizons. He used his knowledge meaningfully to enrich class discussions,
mentor his classmates and to buttress his arguments in essays. Due to his
admirable work ethic, Bevan was able to keep up with the rigorous demands
of the A-Level curriculum. Bevan also pursued opportunities to extend his
learning beyond the classroom. He was a participant in the Junior College
Law Programme (JCLP) where he learned about the complexities of the legal
profession.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a student in the Ignite programme, Bevan embarked on a service learning
project with his classmates to promote the importance of cultivating and
consuming locally grown vegetables as a sustainable food source. Bevan
demonstrated exemplary work ethic during this project: he oversaw the planning
and the setting up of an exhibition in school. Bevan and his classmates
hoped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainability, and to inspire
his schoolmates to make choices that benefit the environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bevan was selected from his English Language and Linguistics (ELL) class
to be a moderator at the CJC-NJC (National Junior College) ELL Symposium
which was graced by esteemed academics and guests from the National University
of Singapore and other schools. Bevan worked hard to prepare for this rare
opportunity to facilitate the discussions between the speakers and the
audience. Quick-witted and adaptable, he was able to think on his feet
and improvise solutions to technical difficulties when they arose.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>CJC’s Ignite programme has enabled me to meet classmates who share common interests in areas like philosophy, literature, language and politics. I found the learning fun as I enjoyed listening to diverse opinions on contentious and challenging issues.</em>
</p>

<h4>Yang Liquan Adam</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/93_CCS_7473.jpg">
</div>
<p>Adam was a participant in the Ignite programme, the college's interdisciplinary
stretch programme for academically talented students. A dedicated and passionate
learner, he constantly sought opportunities to broaden his understanding
of global issues, and sharpen his critical thinking skills. For example,
he participated actively in events such as the annual Ignite conference,
the National Education Symposium, and the History Pre-University Seminar.
He also participated in CJC’s Model United Nations Conference where he
was conferred the Outstanding Delegate award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam was a recipient of the college's prestigious Flame Scholarship that
recognised his leadership capabilities and outstanding contributions to
his Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), Strategy Games Club. He was elected the
President of the Strategy Games Club due to his passion for mentoring and
nurturing others. During moments of disagreement among the executive committee,
Adam showed maturity in mediating these situations, further strengthening
his leadership skills. He instilled confidence in his team members by encouraging
them whenever they encountered obstacles, and was an ever-present source
of help to them. In 2022, Adam represented the college at Hwa Chong Institution's
Bridge Cup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Serving as the President of the Strategy Games Club has definitely honed my leadership skills. My favourite memory during my time as President of the Strategy Games Club is definitely organising CJC’s very own Inter-College Chinese Chess Competition. Despite having to face many different challenges during the planning phase, my fellow EXCO members and I eventually pulled through, and even managed to earn praise from both the students and teachers from other colleges.</em>

<p>Deirdre's empathy for others served her well in her role as the Home Tutorial
Councillor (HTC) of her class. A natural leader who exudes warmth and sincerity,
Deirdre was well-liked by her classmates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always attracted to the power and beauty of the Arts, Deirdre joined Drama
as her Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in college. While learning new skills
as a fledgling thespian was challenging, she made the most of her time
in the CCA by absorbing important lessons from her instructor and peers.
Deirdre worked effectively with her peers to put up an engaging performance
at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation 2022 where they
attained a Certificate of Distinction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an English Literature and English Language and Linguistics (ELL) student,

of the English language. She participated in the Creative Arts Program,
the English Language and Linguistics Symposium, Litera and the Literature
Stretch Programme; Deirdre was also selected to attend the Singapore Perspectives
Conference and was attached to the National Council of Social Services
for an internship which was a requirement of the English Language Elective
Scholarship (ELES) that Deirdre was a recipient of.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>CJC’s Ignite programme allowed me and other like-minded students to study together in a conducive environment. As some of our class sizes were small, we had the privilege of engaging in meaningful discussions. Finally, several events such as the Ignite Symposium enabled us to broaden our knowledge.</em>

her leadership journey, Sarah honed her organisational skills and problem-solving
capabilities, and emerged a more well-rounded and poised individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Serving as the Vice-President of the Student Council was definitely a defining experience.

stint as a CCA leader, Hayden has developed a strong, personal voice which
he will continue to use to inspire others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As the Vice-Captain of the Football CCA, I felt the responsibility to lead the team by example and to ensure that every member felt included. This helped me improve my communication skills.

<blockquote>
<p><em>The College provided useful notes and conducted additional lectures to reinforce key ideas which can be extremely helpful especially for clarifying common misconceptions.

Mention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zhi Rong grew as an individual and a leader throughout his time in the
Film, Sound, and Video Society. As the Vice-President, he not only honed

pressures he faced as a CCA leader, Zhi Rong remained steadfast and unwavering
in his commitment to excelling in his duties.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Film, Sound and Video (FSV) Society is a special CCA as it is a CCA where students learn new skills, and also serve the College.

Besides turning up for all his practice sessions punctually, he worked
closely with the CCA teachers, band conductors as well as the rest of the
Executive Committee members to plan events, uphold high standards of discipline
and look after his bandmates' well-being. He took ownership of his leadership
role and personally mentored juniors to set realistic and achievable goals

to prepare for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation in
2023.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When I first took on the role of Vice-President of the Band, I thought it would be straightforward and manageable, but I soon came to realise that there were many more aspects and challenges to leading a band than I had anticipated. I would say that it was an extremely worthwhile experience as I was able to learn numerous valuable lessons about leadership and collaboration. Serving as the Vice-President also brought me the most joy and fulfillment when I saw how hard each band member worked and how proud they were after each performance or competition.</em>

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/87_CCS_7460.jpg">
</div>
<p>A civic-minded and compassionate individual, Isabel was an active member
of the Interact Club. As the Vice-President of the CCA, a role which she
performed competently, Isabel planned numerous service learning projects
with a view towards benefitting the less fortunate. Isabel and her peers
worked closely with Beyond Social Services, an organisation aimed at helping
children from lower-income families enhance their literacy skills. Through
engaging and guided reading sessions, Isabel added value to the lives of
the children she worked with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isabel also demonstrated her unwavering commitment to community service
by participating in the Interact Club's Cambodia Overseas Service-Learning
Project (OSLP). The aim of this project was to make an impact on the lives
of Cambodian girls by teaching them basic computer skills. As part of the
project, the team also donated several laptops to the Cambodian students.
Isabel’s exemplary work ethic shone through her involvement in this project:
She went the extra mile to take lessons in basic Khmer before teaching
her own CCA members; this was to ensure that they were able to have a basic
conversation with the Cambodian girls. Isabel also devoted her time and
efforts to a service learning project in collaboration with the Bone Marrow
Donor Programme. Isabel designed an awareness campaign to educate her peers
about the challenges faced by patients who need bone marrow transplants.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Being the Vice-President of the Interact Club has helped me develop my leadership abilities and also allowed me to cultivate many other qualities. I have learnt to become more adaptable and patient when dealing with different situations and different types of people. I remember starting out as a timid individual as I did not have prior leadership experience; through my role as the Vice-President, I became more confident in my leadership abilities and more comfortable with voicing my opinions.</em>

</div>
<p>As a member of CJC’s Ignite Programme, designed for critical thinkers
and future-oriented leaders, Lauren demonstrated effective communication,
adaptability, and tenacity, positioning her as a promising individual ready
to make a meaningful difference in her future endeavours. Her perseverance
and strong work ethic were evident in her research into food security in
Singapore as part of her class’ Local Service Learning Project. Through
this project, Lauren gained a deeper understanding of the various food
sources available locally, including artificial options such as lab-grown
meat.</p>
<p>Lauren also successfully navigated the challenges and rigours of competitive
sport, adeptly managing her time between her academic and co-curricular
commitments. An active member of Floorball, Lauren played a vital role
in contributing to her team's remarkable fourth position in the National
School Games 2023 ‘A’ Division.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I joined Floorball in CJC without any prior experience, so it took a lot of effort for me to improve. Learning how to juggle the rigorous demands of a sports CCA with my academic commitments is one of the most important lessons I learnt in CJC. During the National School Games, my J2 Mid-Year examinations were approaching, and I had to set time aside to prepare for both sufficiently. I learnt how to manage my time while ensuring that I was not overexerting myself. I also learnt the importance of consistent practice and drawing support from my teammates.</em>

most of it to strengthen the faith of her Catholic peers.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Through the College’s Catholic events, I was able to meet other Catholic students and form a community here in CJC. I was also able to make friends outside my class and CCA. Some of the lessons that were more focused on how to live a faith-led life while juggling one’s academics gave me new insights, and taught me how to incorporate faith into my day-to-day life.</em>

STE2M Club opened my eyes to new things and made me realise that there is so much more for me to learn and explore. This became a driving force for me whenever I initiated STEM-related workshops. For example, we conducted a 3D modelling workshop where my peers had the opportunity to print their own designs with the 3D printing machine in our College. Beyond the mastery of hard skills, being the President allowed me to hone my soft skills through active collaboration with my fellow committees as we planned and executed activities.Overall, my journey as the STE2M Club President has made me a more confident communicator, equipping me with invaluable skills for the future.</em>

<h4>Khanatip Chok-Oon-Kit</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/91_CCS_7469.jpg">
</div>
<p>Khanatip is an inquisitive and keen learner who&nbsp; did consistently
well in College examinations. He was on the Principal’s Honour Roll for
the JC1 Mid-Year Examination and the JC1 Promotional Examination in 2022.
Furthermore, he was willing to immerse himself deeply in his academic subjects,
as evident from his participation in the Singapore Physics League 2022,
the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad 2022 and the Singapore Mathematical
Olympiad 2022 where he obtained an Honourable Mention.</p>
<p>Khanatip was willing to explore topics beyond the College curriculum and
challenge himself to apply his knowledge in competitions. He participated
in the STEMazing Virtual Race with his classmates during the CJC Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Fest in 2023 where he worked
collaboratively with his team members to solve science and mathematics

Society. A caring and nurturing leader, he tapped on the strengths of his
CCA members to plan and execute several events successfully. He also represented
the College in several competitions such as the Young Founders Summit 2022
where his team obtained the top ten placing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The STEM competitions I took part in required significantly more advanced knowledge than what is typically tested for the A-Level examinations. However, the knowledge I learnt during lessons was foundational to my understanding of the knowledge I needed to do well in those competitions; hence, I had to frequently revisit and revise the topics that are in the A-Level syllabus. This helped reinforce my understanding of STEM concepts and gave me more opportunities to put it into practice.</em>
