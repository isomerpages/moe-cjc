<p>Interreligious Youth with Pope Francis in Catholic Junior College. Minister
for Culture, Community and Youth, Mr Edwin Tong, is seated on Pope Francis’s
right.</p>
<p>In his dialogue with the youth, His Holiness, Pope Francis, exhorted the
young people to have courage, to not be afraid, and to take risks. His
encouraging message to the youth was shared by Mrs Woo Soo Min, Principal,
CJC, who believes that the young people have what it takes to exercise
agency to lead their peers to examine the deeper issues of interreligious
unity amidst diversity. She added, “interreligious unity is not a distant
slogan, nor a mere aspiration. It is something that we, especially the
youths of today, can realise through collective will to build that common
good, one that is enduring and promotes the dignity of all, regardless
of race and religion.”</p>

<p>Thank you and God bless you, Papa Francesco!</p>
<p>The CJC community gives thanks to God and extends her deepest appreciation
to everyone who helped to make this Interreligious Youth with Pope Francis,
experienced in different ways, a personal encounter with God through the
Holy Father. Inspired by the words shared by the Holy Father, may we live
our lives promoting the human dignity of all for the common good of society,
in solidarity with all in our midst.</p>
<p>Thank you, Papa Francesco. We will pray for you!</p>
