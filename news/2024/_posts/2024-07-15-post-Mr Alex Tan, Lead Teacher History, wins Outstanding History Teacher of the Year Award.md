<p>Congratulations to <strong>Mr Alex Tan, Lead Teacher History</strong>,
for winning the <strong>Outstanding History Teacher of the Year Award</strong>!</p>
<p>“I am deeply honoured to be nominated by the college for the <strong>Outstanding History Teacher of the Year 2023/2024 Award</strong>,
and receiving it was certainly serendipitous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;More than anything else, this recognition is an affirmation of the
collective efforts and dedication of the CJ team of History teachers to
create a nurturing learning environment for students to develop a love
for History, as well as the historical knowledge, skills, and dispositions
essential to helping them navigate the increasingly complex world out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;History is not just about the past; it is also about the present
and the future. It is certainly a privilege to have the chance to teach
what is more than a subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you for this incredible honour!”</p>
