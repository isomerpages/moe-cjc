<p><strong>MOE Press Release 16 January 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>Catholic Junior College (CJC) today announced its decision to relocate
from its Whitley Road campus by 2034 to a new site in Punggol, in the vicinity
of the Punggol Digital District. The announcement was made at the signing
of Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between CJC and its key partners, held
at Punggol Digital District, Lobby of Tower 86, with Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Gan Kim Yong, Grassroots Adviser
for Punggol GRC Grassroots Organisations, as Guest of Honour. Also present
were Minister for Education Mr Desmond Lee, along with representatives
from partner organisations, alumni, parents and students.</p>
<p>The move marks a significant new chapter for the College, positioning
CJC to deepen and differentiate the pre-university experience through closer
integration with higher education, industry, community and nature-based
environments, while strengthening its long-standing tradition as a home
for the Humanities and Arts, where critical inquiry, ethical reasoning
and human discernment remain central to learning, alongside a broad and
rigorous A-Level education.</p>
<p>The relocation follows careful study over several years and was guided
by three considerations: the ageing Whitley Road campus, which was completed
in the 1970s, the availability of a site in Punggol to serve the community
in the north-east region of Singapore, and the strategic educational opportunities
presented by the neighbouring Punggol Digital District. Taken together,
these factors informed the decision to relocate, allowing CJC to build
on its existing strengths in student learning, community engagement and
holistic formation.</p>
<p>To anchor this next phase, CJC today signed Memorandums of Understanding
(MOUs) with a group of key partners to formalise programme collaborations
and joint initiatives. These partners include the Singapore Institute of
Technology (SIT), National Youth Council (NYC), National Parks Board (NParks),
Pathlight School, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Digital
and Intelligence Service (DIS) and JTC Corporation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These partnerships reflect a shared commitment to creating authentic learning
experiences beyond the classroom, spanning digital capability, sustainability,
community engagement and inclusive education. CJC will begin collaborating
with partners from this year, with programmes and student opportunities
progressively developed and introduced over the next year. These collaborations
will commence well ahead of the physical move, allowing students to benefit
from educational synergies even before the new campus is completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This relocation represents a considered and forward-looking step in CJC’s
journey. While our address will change, what defines us does not. Being
close neighbours with the Punggol Digital</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>District allows us to build more intentionally on CJC’s existing strengths
in academic rigour, character formation and community engagement, by situating
our students within a rich ecosystem of learning, innovation and civic
life. It is an opportunity to deepen what we already do well, while preparing
our students for the realities of a rapidly evolving Singapore,” said <strong>Mr Bernard Tan, Chairman, School Management Committee, Catholic Junior College.</strong>

</p>
<h1>A Unique Position Close to a National Digital District</h1>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>PDD has been purpose-built as a national hub where education, innovation,
industry and community life converge. The proximity of CJC’s new campus
to PDD will allow the college to provide a uniquely integrated environment
for learning and development. The wider PDD brings together industry, applied
research, community facilities, residential neighbourhoods and green spaces,
creating a living environment where learning, work and community life intersect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Trade and Industry, and Grassroots Adviser for Punggol GRC, Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, </strong>“The
Punggol Digital District (PDD) is Singapore’s flagship innovation district,
designed to integrate education, industry, community, and nature. The relocation
of Catholic Junior College will situate pre-university education within
an ecosystem where knowledge is applied, skills are developed, and students
can better connect what they learn to the world beyond school. This way,
we can build a place where learning, work and community life come together,
and where different generations can grow and thrive<strong>.”</strong>

<p>The new campus is targeted for operation tentatively in 2034. Programme
development and pilot initiatives with partners will, however, start well
before the physical move.</p>
