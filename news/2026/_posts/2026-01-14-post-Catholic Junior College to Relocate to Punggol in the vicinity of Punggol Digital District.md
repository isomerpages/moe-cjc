<p><strong>MOE Press Release 16 January 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>Catholic Junior College (CJC) today announced its decision to relocate
from its Whitley Road campus by 2034 to a new site in Punggol, in the vicinity
of the Punggol Digital District. The announcement was made at the signing
of Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between CJC and its key partners, held
at Punggol Digital District, Lobby of Tower 86, with Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Gan Kim Yong, Grassroots Adviser
for Punggol GRC Grassroots Organisations, as Guest of Honour. Also present
were Minister for Education Mr Desmond Lee, along with representatives
from partner organisations, alumni, parents and students.</p>
<p>The move marks a significant new chapter for the College, positioning
CJC to deepen and differentiate the pre-university experience through closer
integration with higher education, industry, community and nature-based
environments, while strengthening its long-standing tradition as a home
for the Humanities and Arts, where critical inquiry, ethical reasoning
and human discernment remain central to learning, alongside a broad and
rigorous A-Level education.</p>
<p>The relocation follows careful study over several years and was guided
by three considerations: the ageing Whitley Road campus, which was completed
in the 1970s, the availability of a site in Punggol to serve the community
in the north-east region of Singapore, and the strategic educational opportunities
presented by the neighbouring Punggol Digital District. Taken together,
these factors informed the decision to relocate, allowing CJC to build
on its existing strengths in student learning, community engagement and
holistic formation.</p>
<p>To anchor this next phase, CJC today signed Memorandums of Understanding
(MOUs) with a group of key partners to formalise programme collaborations
and joint initiatives. These partners include the Singapore Institute of
Technology (SIT), National Youth Council (NYC), National Parks Board (NParks),
Pathlight School, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Digital
and Intelligence Service (DIS) and JTC Corporation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These partnerships reflect a shared commitment to creating authentic learning
experiences beyond the classroom, spanning digital capability, sustainability,
community engagement and inclusive education. CJC will begin collaborating
with partners from this year, with programmes and student opportunities
progressively developed and introduced over the next year. These collaborations
will commence well ahead of the physical move, allowing students to benefit
from educational synergies even before the new campus is completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This relocation represents a considered and forward-looking step in CJC’s
journey. While our address will change, what defines us does not. Being
close neighbours with the Punggol Digital District allows us to build more
intentionally on CJC’s existing strengths in academic rigour, character
formation and community engagement, by situating our students within a
rich ecosystem of learning, innovation and civic life. It is an opportunity
to deepen what we already do well, while preparing our students for the
realities of a rapidly evolving Singapore,” said <strong>Mr Bernard Tan, Chairman, School Management Committee, Catholic Junior College.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<h4>A Unique Position Close to a National Digital District<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>PDD has been purpose-built as a national hub where education, innovation,
industry and community life converge. The proximity of CJC’s new campus
to PDD will allow the college to provide a uniquely integrated environment
for learning and development. The wider PDD brings together industry, applied
research, community facilities, residential neighbourhoods and green spaces,
creating a living environment where learning, work and community life intersect.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Trade and Industry, and Grassroots Adviser for Punggol GRC, Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, </strong>“The
Punggol Digital District (PDD) is Singapore’s flagship innovation district,
designed to integrate education, industry, community, and nature. The relocation
of Catholic Junior College will situate pre-university education within
an ecosystem where knowledge is applied, skills are developed, and students
can better connect what they learn to the world beyond school. This way,
we can build a place where learning, work and community life come together,
and where different generations can grow and thrive<strong>.”&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The new campus is targeted for operation tentatively in 2034. Programme
development and pilot initiatives with partners will, however, start well
before the physical move.</p>
<h4>The 4 Pillars: CJC’s Future-Focused Educational Identity</h4>
<p><strong>1) Being Digital: Innovation with Human Intelligence at the Centre&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Being located close to PDD will allow CJC to develop programmes that expose
students to areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data-driven
systems, while keeping human judgement, ethics and creativity at the centre
of learning. Digital capability will cut across disciplines, including
the Humanities and Arts. These programmes are designed to help students
understand how technology shapes society, decision-making and human relationships,
affirming the Humanities as essential to interpreting, questioning and
guiding technological change, rather than merely adapting to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Being Sustainable: Learning with, and for, Our Community and Nation</strong>
</p>
<p>Drawing on Punggol’s coastal environment, waterways and proximity to nature,
CJC will integrate sustainability into authentic student learning. Programmes
will connect classroom knowledge with real-world environmental challenges,
allowing students to engage in conservation, circularity and eco-stewardship
initiatives that build habits of care for the environment. Sustainability
education at CJC will be experiential and action-oriented, helping students
see the relationship between science, policy, community and long-term national
resilience.</p>
<p><strong>3) Being Singaporean: A Community-Connected Campus Built on Social Friendship</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>CJC’s new campus will be open and deeply connected
to the community, building not just proximity with the heartlands, but
the spirit of social friendship. Programmes will foster a strong sense
of citizenship, empathy and shared responsibility, helping students appreciate
the duties and obligations of living in a diverse society. By engaging
meaningfully with the community, students will develop a grounded understanding
of what it means to contribute to Singapore’s social fabric, drawing on
perspectives from history, literature, philosophy and the social sciences
to better understand identity, diversity and shared responsibility in a
complex society.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4) Being Values-Driven: A Foundation for Character and Purpose&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Amidst these changes, CJC will continue to be guided by its long-standing
Catholic values and ethos, with an emphasis on character, ethics and service.
The College remains welcoming to students of all backgrounds, and its mission
will continue to focus on forming young people of conscience, compassion
and courage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The purpose of education is not merely to prepare students to make a
living. It is about forming young people to live lives of dignity and respect.
As CJC moves forward, its commitment to the broad Catholic principles of
Truth and Love remains a steady foundation, guiding how young people are
formed regardless of changes in place or circumstance,” said <strong>Monsignor Stephen Yim, Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Singapore.</strong>
</p>
<h4>The Cornerstone Differentiator: Collaborative Learning Synergies between CJC and SIT</h4>
<p>Within this setting, CJC will be close neighbours with the Singapore Institute
of Technology. CJC’s proximity to SIT opens up opportunities for earlier
exposure to university learning and applied education, helping students
make more informed post-A-Level choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through collaborative programmes, CJC students will gain early exposure
to selected areas of university studies by working alongside SIT’s academic
staff and students to explore issues and prototype solutions to real-world
challenges, including those that make a positive social impact in the Punggol
community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CJC students will also be able to tap on SIT’s talent pool as resource
persons to help fulfil their GCE A-level examination and Project Work assessment.
The impact of the partnership will also go beyond the two institutions,
as they collaborate on outreach activities for secondary schools in Punggol
and beyond. Both institutions will also explore shared infrastructure and
optimised use of facilities to expand access for students and the wider
community. These initiatives span diverse fields such as engineering, IT
and digital media, sustainability, and healthcare, and aim to nurture character
formation and foster early talent cultivation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Professor Chua Kee Chaing, President, Singapore Institute of Technology, </strong>said:
“CJC’s proximity to SIT creates powerful synergy. For CJC students interested
in applied learning at the University level, they gain exposure to SIT’s
modules and applied research projects. For SIT students, this partnership
creates the platform for joint initiatives that reinforce their technical
mastery while honing leadership, mentorship and problem-solving skills.”</p>
