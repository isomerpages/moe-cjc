<p><strong>MOE Press Release 16 January 2026</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 16 January 2026 </strong>– Catholic Junior College
(CJC) today announced its decision to relocate from its Whitley Road campus
to a new site in Punggol, in the vicinity of the Punggol Digital District
(PDD). The new campus is targeted for operation tentatively in 2034. The
announcement was made at the signing of Memorandums of Understanding (MOU)
between CJC and its key partners, held at PDD with Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Trade and Industry, and Grassroots Adviser for Punggol
GRC Grassroots Organisations, Mr Gan Kim Yong, as Guest of Honour. Also
present were Minister for Education Mr Desmond Lee, along with representatives
from partner organisations, alumni, parents and students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move marks a significant new chapter for the College, positioning
CJC to deepen and differentiate the pre-university experience through closer
integration with higher education, industry, community and nature-based
environments, while strengthening its long-standing tradition as a home
for the Humanities and Arts, where critical inquiry, ethical reasoning
and human discernment remain central to learning, alongside a broad and
rigorous A-Level education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relocation follows careful study over several years and was guided
by three considerations: the ageing Whitley Road campus, which was completed
in the 1970s, the availability of a site in Punggol to serve the community
in the north-east region of Singapore, and the strategic educational opportunities
presented by the neighbouring PDD. Taken together, these factors informed
the decision to relocate, allowing CJC to build on its existing strengths
in student learning, community engagement and holistic formation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To anchor this next phase, CJC today signed MOUs with a group of key partners
to formalise programme collaborations and joint initiatives. These partners
include Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), JTC Corporation, National
Parks Board (NParks), National Youth Council (NYC), Pathlight School and
Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>These partnerships reflect a shared commitment to creating authentic learning
experiences beyond the classroom, spanning digital capability, sustainability,
community engagement and inclusive education. CJC will begin collaborating
with partners from this year, with programmes and student opportunities
progressively developed and introduced over the next year. These collaborations
will commence well ahead of the physical move, allowing students to benefit
from educational synergies even before the new campus is completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This relocation represents a considered and forward-looking step in CJC’s
journey. While our address will change, what defines us does not. Being
close neighbours with the PDD allows us to build more intentionally on
CJC’s existing strengths in academic rigour, character formation and community
engagement, by situating our students within a rich ecosystem of learning,
innovation and civic life. It is an opportunity to deepen what we already
do well, while preparing our students for the realities of a rapidly evolving
Singapore,” said <strong>Mr Bernard Tan, Chairman, School Management Committee, Catholic Junior College.</strong>
</p>
<h4>A Unique Position Close to a National Digital District<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Masterplanned, built, and managed by JTC, PDD has been purpose-built as
a national hub where education, innovation, industry and community life
converge. The proximity of CJC’s new campus to PDD will allow the college
to provide a uniquely integrated environment for learning and development.
Industry, applied research, community facilities, residential neighbourhoods
and green spaces come together, creating a living environment where learning,
work and community life intersect.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, and Grassroots Adviser for Punggol GRC Grassroots Organisations Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>,
said, “The PDD is Singapore’s flagship innovation district, designed to
integrate education, industry, community, and nature. The relocation of
CJC to the vicinity of PDD will situate pre-university education within
an ecosystem where knowledge is applied, skills are developed, and students
can better connect what they learn to the world beyond school. This way,
we can build a place where learning, work and community life come together,
and where different generations can grow and thrive.”</p>
<h4>The 4 Pillars: CJC’s Future-Focused Educational Identity<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1) Being Digital: Innovation with Human Intelligence at the Centre&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Being located close to PDD will allow CJC to develop programmes that expose
students to areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data-driven
systems, while keeping human judgement, ethics and creativity at the centre
of learning. Digital capability will cut across disciplines, including
the Humanities and Arts. These programmes are designed to help students
understand how technology shapes society, decision-making and human relationships,
affirming the Humanities as essential to interpreting, questioning and
guiding technological change, rather than merely adapting to it.</p>
<p><strong>2) Being Sustainable: Learning with, and for, Our Community and Nation</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Drawing on Punggol’s coastal environment, waterways and proximity to nature,
CJC will integrate sustainability into authentic student learning. Programmes
will connect classroom knowledge with real-world environmental challenges,
allowing students to engage in conservation, circularity and eco-stewardship
initiatives that build habits of care for the environment. Sustainability
education at CJC will be experiential and action-oriented, helping students
see the relationship between science, policy, community and long-term national
resilience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3) Being Singaporean: A Community-Connected Campus Built on Social Friendship</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>CJC’s new campus will be open and deeply connected to the community, building
not just proximity with the heartlands, but the spirit of social friendship.
Programmes will foster a strong sense of citizenship, empathy and shared
responsibility, helping students appreciate the duties and obligations
of living in a diverse society. By engaging meaningfully with the community,
students will develop a grounded understanding of what it means to contribute
to Singapore’s social fabric, drawing on perspectives from history, literature,
philosophy and the social sciences to better understand identity, diversity
and shared responsibility in a complex society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4) Being Values-Driven: A Foundation for Character and Purpose</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Amidst these changes, CJC will continue to be guided by its long-standing
Catholic values and ethos, with an emphasis on character, ethics and service.
The College remains welcoming to students of all backgrounds, and its mission
will continue to focus on forming young people of conscience, compassion
and courage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The purpose of education is not merely to prepare students to make a
living. It is about forming young people to live lives of dignity and respect.
As CJC moves forward, its commitment to the broad Catholic principles of
Truth and Love remains a steady foundation, guiding how young people are
formed regardless of changes in place or circumstance,” said <strong>Monsignor Stephen Yim, Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Singapore.&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
