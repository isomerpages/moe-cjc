Catholic Junior College (CJC) held its annual cross country at Pasir Ris Park on 10 Mar this year, bringing together staff, students, and invited guests from the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH).  
  
Our spirits were uplifted with the clear, blue skies and gusty winds as we completed the run together as One Flame, One Family. We give thanks to God, our Father, for blessing us with great weather and the opportunity to walk in step with each other, especially with friends from SAVH, after the pandemic.  
The Cross Country was a great success - a testament of the fine team work by the House Committees, Sports Leaders and the PE/CCA Department, and the event came to a rousing finish with Patrick House crowned Champions that day!
