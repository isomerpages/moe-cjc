**About the SOF-Peter Lim Scholarship (http://sof.sg/scholarship/)**<br>
In June 2010, the Singapore Olympic Foundation (SOF) set up the SOF-Peter Lim Scholarship with a S$10-million donation from philanthropist and sports enthusiast, Mr Peter Lim. The gift remains the single largest donation in Singapore from an individual towards sports development.

The driving force behind the Scholarship is the desire to ensure that no promising young athlete, committed to chasing his sporting dreams, should be hampered by financial considerations.

The Scholarship aims to:

*   Help young deserving sports talents from humble backgrounds to achieve their sporting goals;
*   Support under-18, high-performing athletes to pursue sporting excellence in their chosen fields.
*   From 2011 to 2013, more than 700 scholarships, totaling over S$2 million, were disbursed.

#### **Singapore Youth Festival 2014**
CJC Drama Society clinched a Certificate of Distinction for their rendition of _Poop_, a play by local playwright Chong Tze Chien.
