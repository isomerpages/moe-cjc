We're proud to announce that one of our JC2 teams achieved a Merit award at the International Space Challenge (Starter Category), held from November-December 2022. This marks the 3rd year CJC has taken part in this competition, as well as the first time we have won an award. 

Our heartiest congratulations to Yuan Mengfei from 2T07, Han Rui from 2T10 and Steve Aureel from 2T28 for their excellent achievement. This achievement is the result of their dedication and hard work in the face of numerous challenges, and we applaud their resilience and efforts.

I’m Steve Jan Aureel from 2T28 and on behalf of my team, I would like to share a short reflection on the International Space Challenge that the 3 of us took part in ast year from Oct - Dec 2022.

The journey of following this competition all the way to completion is not an easy one. Our inexperience in this field proved to be a huge obstacle when it came to coming up with a sensible idea let alone the deliverables. However, through the guidance of our teacher and our mentors, we managed to learn a lot about astronomy and specifically about how satellites work and how much potential they hold to help us in our daily lives. We also had some hiccups along the way, unforeseen circumstances and distance made it really difficult to meet up and discuss. Yet, our team pulled through all the way to the end and we won a merit award as well as a cash prize of $500. This award is more than just a proof of our capabilities as a team, but also as proof of our grit and perseverance through-out the journey. Winners or not, I am proud to be a member of the team and forever grateful to our teacher Ms Tay Su Lynn and Alumni mentor Hubert Khoo who encouraged us to not give up.
