The English Language and Linguistics symposium, held at Catholic Junior College on 12th May 2023, was jointly organised by Catholic Junior College and National Junior College. As indicated by the name of the symposium ("Can meh? Are we really okay with Singlish?") the focus of the symposium was on Singlish. The invited speakers—Dr Tay May Yin, Assistant Professor Luke Lu, and Assistant Professor Geraldine Quek—captivated the attention of the hundreds of participants in attendance which comprised students from junior colleges offering English Language and Linguistics (ELL) as an A-level subject, and selected secondary schools. The speakers delved into the multifaceted role of Singlish in our education system, its impact on shaping culture, and its prevalence in our daily lives.

After the enlightening presentations, the students engaged in a stimulating question and answer session where they posed thought-provoking questions about the impact of English in many areas of Singapore life. Subsequently, prizes were awarded to the teams that excelled in the poster design competition. Students had been tasked to create posters to either promote code-switching or discourage the excessive use of Singlish. The winning teams hailed from Hai Sing Catholic School, School of Science and Technology and Commonwealth Secondary School.

Through the symposium, the students learnt more about how English and Singlish play separate but vital roles in our society not only as a language to connect Singaporeans across racial and class barriers, but also as a language to connect Singapore to the world. It deepened their appreciation for English Language and Linguistics which fosters conversations about how language can shape society and human behaviour.
