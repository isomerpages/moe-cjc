On 31st May 2023, CJ Celebrates brought together students, teachers and parents into the bustling Performing Arts Centre (PAC) where they were enthralled by outstanding performances by CJC’s Performing Arts CCAs. This annual extravaganza is a showcase of the CCAs that earned Certificates of Merit and Distinction at this year’s Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).

The evening unfolded with the first performance – “Summer” and “Winter” – by the Guzheng Ensemble, portraying the resilience of bamboo and the blooming of a plum blossom in snow respectively. Their performance eloquently conveyed the essence of nature’s beauty and perseverance. The Guitar Ensemble took the stage next, impressively attired in outfits reflecting the origins and mystique of their musical pieces, delivering a fantastic performance blending different melodies into a harmonious whole. An unconventional yet stylish and captivating performance was put up by CJ Dance which showcased their talent and creativity, leaving the audience in awe. Drama (English) then took the stage with their play, “Arsehammers” – a semi-tragic comedy artistically portraying life with Alzheimer’s through the perspective of a young child. The actors brought the characters to life with emotional depth, committing themselves to the characters. The audience was enchanted by the heavenly voices of our Choir, followed by the Symphonic Band whose electrifying performance brought everyone to their feet.&nbsp;

As CJ Celebrates drew to a close, our Principal, Mrs Phyllis Lim distributed hampers filled with teddy bears to the JC2 members of each Performing Arts CCA who were stepping down, commending them for their dedication and efforts to their respective CCAs. The event was a resounding success. The talent displayed throughout the evening was a testament to the hours dedicated to honing their craft and impressing the audience.
