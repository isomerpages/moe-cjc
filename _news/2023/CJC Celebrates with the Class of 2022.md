The Class of 2022 achieved commendable results at the 2022 GCE A-Level examinations and did themselves and the College proud. Catholic Junior College (CJC) maintained its strong value-added performance with good distinction rates across the different A-Level subjects. The school is delighted to have many CJCians realise their aspirations and qualify for reputable local and overseas institutes of higher learning.

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, commended the Class of 2022 for their results and said, “you picked up the pace and seized opportunities to embrace full learning activities once the easing of Safe Management Measures took effect. Despite challenges, you displayed resilience, innovation, and drive to embrace learning with a growth mindset and achieve outstanding results. May you continue to lead and serve as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.”  

Mrs Poon Wai Chin, Vice-Principal/Academic added, “our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2022 on your good results! The many pathways that lie ahead are yours to explore. Hold fast to your dreams and aspirations, while keeping an open mind as you progress in your learning and broaden your experiences. May you demonstrate your passion in all that you do and may the spirit of continuous learning enable you to seize new opportunities and face future challenges with courage and verve.”

The College extends its deepest appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee (SMC) and the alumni for their dedicated support for our CJCians. May God continue to bless our Class of 2022 with grace and wisdom as they take flight as thinkers and leaders who will make a positive impact on society.

The College celebrates the outstanding achievements of the following CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart.
