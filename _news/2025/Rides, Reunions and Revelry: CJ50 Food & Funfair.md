<p>Catholic Junior College was pulsing with excitement as staff and students
in blue added the final touches to their preparations for the CJ50 Food
&amp; Fun Fair. Organised to mark the college’s milestone birthday, the
CJ50 Food &amp; Funfair was certainly a highlight of the school year. The
celebration created everlasting memories for students, staff and alumni
alike, strengthening our ties for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the time to open the event to the public neared, the anticipation was
high as everyone waited for the winning shot that would dunk our Principal
into a tank of cold water. As the sound of our Principal being dunked reverberated
through the school grounds, cheers were met with the sound of confetti
poppers, and the CJ50 Food &amp; Funfair officially began. The sports leaders
then ran out onto the netball court for a flash mob performance, which
certainly hyped up the atmosphere. Rushing out to the school field, the
sight of countless rides greeted everyone, further igniting a sense of
excitement among the students and bringing an exuberant vitality to the
school. In the blink of an eye, our beloved school field, which has witnessed
fifty years of learning and laughter, transformed into a vibrant festival
ground, where the spirit of celebration replaced the usual rhythm of academic
life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amidst the blasting music, crowds gathered around the food stalls, which
tempted the crowd with their mouth-watering treats. The warm, savoury aroma
of pizza and burgers wafted through the college, drawing in hungry fairgoers
eager to satisfy their stomachs. The Over The Hill satay stall, manned
by a family of CJC alumni, attracted mountains of people as they dressed
in Satay Man garb and rang bells, calling upon onlookers to taste the tantalising
smell that wafted through the hot air.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the hunger for sustenance, but also for the thrill
that kept the visitors going. The 50th Anniversary Food and Funfair had
also advertised many adrenaline-inducing rides. The main attraction, the
Meteorite ride, provided a breathtaking view of the entire fairground at
its peak, while it sent riders screaming with joy as it twisted and turned
at exhilarating speeds. Complementing the spinning tilted metal cage full
of screaming fairgoers, the school’s sheltered courts are filled with a
plethora of other enticing rides. The intensity of the rides varied with
different surprises to show off to our CJ family. From the simple ones
like the Gyrospin to the challenging Rodeo Bull, these rides did not fail
to entertain and create wonderful memories among current and past CJCians
and their loved ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the animated chatter of the bustling crowds gradually filled the air,
the mesmerising voices of our very own CJCians echoed throughout the school,
courtesy of the engaging and seamless rotation of performances executed
by our student and alumni bands. At the same time, the harmonious teamwork
displayed by our students in manning and promoting the games was met with
a passionate eagerness from the public to give their best in the simple
but thrilling activities innovated by the students. The hospitality and
energy shown by everyone was palpable as observed by Mr Mark Li, JC2 Year
Head -- “It’s wonderful to see how CJCians are very excited to introduce
their games and having people play!” The service stalls also did not disappoint
as many students flaunted their creative talents in attempting face and
arm painting designs, recreating hairstyles, painting nails and so on,
which equally amassed an outstanding reception.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the auditorium, the CJ50 Marketplace was overwhelmed with
activity, as student representatives from various classes prepared an array
of snacks, household items, and handmade crocheted items. In true marketplace
fashion, the hustle for the items ensued as soon as the prices were lowered,
with crowds of people clamouring for the opportunity to buy the coveted
items in the final moments of the carnival, emptying the tables.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>The joyous occasion was a window into the sense of community and camaraderie
that has characterised life at CJC over the years. As students, staff,
and visitors came together to celebrate our school's golden jubilee, their
shared enthusiasm and dedication created something truly special – a reminder
of how this institution has been more than just a school; it has been a
home to generations of learners for half a century.&nbsp;</p>
