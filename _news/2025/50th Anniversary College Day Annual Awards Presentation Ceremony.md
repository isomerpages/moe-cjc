</p>
<p>Awards are not simply given to praise one's outstanding achievements.
They hide stories of determination, friendship, and the countless moments
that shape our journey to excellence. As we gathered for our 50th Anniversary
College Day, we were reminded of the college’s legacy and the&nbsp; cherished
values that have guided our community for fifty years.</p>
<p>The boisterous chat between a teacher and an alumni, reminiscing about
the past and embracing the precious memories they have shared; the fervour
of JC2 students, waiting to be immersed in the grandeur of such a momentous
occasion – such vitality imbued the atmosphere of the school foyer before
the ceremony.</p>
<p>The momentous occasion began with a grand procession. In a distinguished
manner, the alumni teachers, and Principal and Vice-Principals, strode
towards the centre of the auditorium and lined up according to their years
of graduation. A mixture of pride and gratitude permeated the air as they
were greeted with warm applause.</p>
<p>Thereafter, words of wisdom and faith were imparted unto us during the
opening prayer by our College Chaplain. We were reminded of our mission
as vessels of God, that Christ called upon us to be one collective body.
As we reflected on how we can be together as one body, we realised that
every aspect of our school life is connected by the bond we share as one
CJ family. This bond is ingrained in the hearts of our CJ alumni, bringing
them back to preserve a spirit of love and compassion. A valuable part
of the CJC journey is having communion and love with one another, and being
reminded that God is love. When we behold God's love, we blossom in mind,
body and spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Principal, Mrs Woo, then spoke about building a generation <em>in Truth and Love</em>,
and building every CJCian to be a <em>Thinker with a Mission and a Leader with a Heart</em>.
This is exemplified through the achievements of CJCians reflected by their
vocations, and the impact of CJCians reflected in various sectors of society.
CJCians have gone so far in the light of their passion to contribute towards
the betterment of society. The variety of vocations taken up by CJCians
is truly a myriad: Public service, Law, Healthcare, Academia, Journalism,
the Arts, Entertainment, Social enterprise, Military and Defence, Sports,
Education and Catholic Priesthood. These vocations epitomise the values
of the college <em>in Veritate Et Caritate</em>. Mrs Woo was proud to experience
the values and achievements displayed by the students.</p>
<p>The Guest of Honour, Professor Tan Tai Yong (Class of 1979), current President
of the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), then gave his address.
He gave a revelatory sharing on the current measure of what success entails
in this advanced world, where time and tide wait for no man. We should
define success on our own terms, and redefine it as we grow. We should
pursue deeper purposes, and not just transient things. We should recalibrate
our approach towards acquiring skills and expertise, to look beyond the
current slate of careers and focus our minds on the overarching state of
the world.</p>
<p>The most lively and eventful segment of the awards presentation ceremony
began shortly after Professor Tan’s address. Students, staff and teachers
strode up to the stage with ecstasy and fulfillment. Laughter, smiles and
handshakes were exchanged between the award recipients and presenters –
an extravagant display of heartfelt emotions weaved into a simple yet profound
gesture of recognising achievements with an honourable plaque or certificate.</p>
<p>Chloe Pang Kai Yi, a JC3 student who won the Outstanding Contribution
Award for her time as President of the Editorial Club is currently serving
in the Singapore Navy. When asked about how she felt coming back to her
alma mater, she said, “[I was] very excited to come back.” She reminisced
about how she spent most of her time studying in school, including at the
Night Study programme. CJC was a place where she found her purpose and
grew a lot as a person.</p>
<p>When asked why she chose to join the Navy, she said, “[There is] no harm
in trying something new, even if you don't like [it, you] can change. [I
am] not the patriotic kind, but it’s exciting. [You] can tell others that
you’re a woman but also do military related stuff. [It’s] very rewarding.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>During her time as the President of the Editorial Club, Chloe had made
invaluable contributions such as taking the initiative to start an Instagram
page for the CCA. She reflected that the CCA has made her a more empathetic
person as she needed to know the struggles that her CCA mates faced when
they could not produce work on time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the academic front, Kevin Duethorn, a JC2 student who topped his cohort
in H2 Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics, said, “It’s all about quality
over quantity when it comes to studying.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A study tip that he shared was the Feynman Technique where students try
to teach the topics they are revising to others who are unfamiliar with
it. It requires students to know the content well and be able to articulate
in a way that even beginners can understand. He also noted that not every
study method works for everyone and that it’s more important to find what
works best for you.</p>
<p>Mr Martino Tan, CJC alumnus and co-founder of <em>Mothership</em> was also
present at the event. He said, “[it was] quite emotional for me when the
Guest of Honour spoke about the historical context of the school.” It reminded
him of his time in CJC and it also made him a little anxious about the
changing world. It was also a good time for him to catch up with his friends
during the Tea Reception after the ceremony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what values do awards hold?</p>
<p>Awards are a symbol of honour which captures the <strong>significance</strong> of
an achievement – the relentless hard work, consultations with teachers,
support from friends and family, all of these are attributed towards the
significance of an achievement. Awards encapsulate the <strong>memories</strong> behind
an achievement, here reminding us of all who have been with us throughout
our journey in CJC. Awards also accentuate <strong>admiration and respect</strong>.
The admiration and respect of one's talent or commitments towards a goal.
There is so much more than just the prestige of an award. It is a grand
compass of all the memories and dedication one underwent to strive for
excellence, and should be recognised with joy and celebration.</p>
<p>As we celebrate 50 years of Truth and Love, these awards take on an even
greater significance. They become not just symbols of individual achievement,
but testaments to half a century of memories, relationships, and values
that have been passed down through generations of CJCians. Each award presented
today honours not just the recipient, but the enduring spirit of excellence
and community that has defined our college for fifty remarkable years.</p>
