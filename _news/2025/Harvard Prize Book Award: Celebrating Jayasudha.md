<p>We are proud to celebrate Jayasudha Ramaswamy, recipient of the prestigious
Harvard Prize Book Award 2024/25, presented by the Harvard Club of Singapore.
This award recognizes students who exemplify excellence in service and
leadership, alongside a deep commitment to caring for their communities
— values that Jayasudha has consistently embodied throughout her time at
CJC.</p>
<p>As Vice-President of the Interact Club, Jayasudha demonstrated servant
leadership that was both heartfelt and impactful. She led a book donation
drive to support literacy efforts for children in Nepal, rallying her peers
to contribute meaningfully to an international cause. She also spearheaded
Project Merakee, a student-led initiative in partnership with Save Our
Street Dogs (SOSD), raising awareness and funds for abandoned animals while
fostering empathy and civic responsibility within the college.</p>
<p>In recognition of her outstanding contributions, Jayasudha was awarded
both the CJC Merit Award (Service) and the Outstanding CCA Award (Interact
Club) during College Day. She also completed the requirements for the National
Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Gold, and returned earlier this year to
share her journey with the current JC1 cohort — inspiring them to pursue
their goals with purpose and compassion.</p>
<p>Jayasudha’s achievements are a testament not only to her personal drive
and compassion, but also to the support and guidance of her Home Tutor,
Ms Meiqi, and her CCA Teacher-in-Charge, Ms Yuni. Their mentorship played
a vital role in nurturing her growth as a leader committed to living out
our College values of Truth and Love.</p>
<p>We celebrate Jayasudha for her unwavering commitment to service, and for
inspiring those around her to lead with heart and purpose. Congratulations,
Jayasudha, on this well-deserved honor.</p>
