</div>
<p>Amelia is a hard-working and conscientious student with a zest for learning
and discovery. Throughout her junior college journey, she strove to excel
in her studies whilst making time for her interests. An eager learner,
she would regularly schedule consultations with her teachers to clarify
her doubts and learning gaps. Additionally, she would consistently review
and reflect on her work, making strides to advance in her studies. Her
efforts paid off, as she was not only the 2023 JC1 Top Performer for H1
General Paper and H1 Literature, but also one of the top scorers in CJC
for the A-Levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her ardour for her interests was evident as her passion for Literature
led her to explore different styles of writing and poetry. Eager to develop
her writing, she joined the MOE Creative Arts Programme, where she experienced
a nine month-long mentorship under the guidance of a local writer. She
also pursued her interest in biology through her participation in the NTU
Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine Anatomy Challenge 2024. Amelia was also
a dedicated member of her CCA, Guzheng Ensemble. Despite being a beginner,
she worked hard during and outside of CCA hours to improve her guzheng
and interpersonal skills. Additionally, she participated in her CCA’s student-initiated
LSLP.</p>
<p>“I am thankful to God for seeing me through each day of my journey, and
my family for their&nbsp; help every day, from making breakfast to reminding
me to enjoy my education regardless of my&nbsp; grades. I am also grateful
for all my teachers—especially Dr Lim, Mr Yang, and Instructor Sophie—
who taught and supported me patiently, helping me enjoy the subjects and
extracurriculars I took. I&nbsp; am appreciative of my friends in JC who
were with me daily, doing tutorials together in the morning&nbsp; and after
class, cheering me up when I was tired. My non-JC friends too, who despite
not understanding my work or subjects, reminded me to relax and supported
me until the end.”</p>

teammates fostered a culture of camaraderie and determination, making him
a pillar of support within the team. Through rigorous training sessions
and high-stakes competitions, Luis displayed composure under pressure,
embracing every challenge as an opportunity for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Personally, I believe I had a great work-life balance and I can attribute
it to time management and studying efficiently. As much as possible, I
strived to keep my study sessions productive whereby I was engaged and
using my brain, instead of merely reading the lecture notes … When I felt
like I could not sit at my desk even longer, I would go for runs which
I not only enjoy, but also keep me active amidst the busy exam season.
I would also meet up with my friends when I felt overwhelmed, which allowed
me to unwind and be able to go back to studying.”</p>

</div>
<p>Coco is an exceptional, well-rounded student with an aptitude for learning
and self-fulfilment. Her love for literature can be captured through her
thoughtful analysis on different subject matters, showing her profound
appreciation of the complexities of the world. Coco continued her journey

award that recognises acts of service carried out by students .</p>
<p>“I would like to extend my gratitude to all CJ teachers… I have approached
subject tutors of another class to consult on some subjects, and they have
not only accepted my request with open arms, they were immensely helpful.
Hence, thank you to every single teacher in CJC for caring for us students.”</p>

<p><strong>KEE RUI YING CHARLOTTE</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 30%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/KEE_RUI_YING_CHARLOTTE_min.jpg">
</div>
<p>Charlotte is an intellectually curious student who understands new ideas
quickly. She frequently seeks a deeper understanding of issues and is able
to put forth her views clearly and respectfully during academic discussions.
Her intellectual disposition led her to be granted a place in CJC’s Ignite+
Talent Development programme, a 2-year interdisciplinary programme that
challenges students to think critically and creatively. Her strong academic
performance also enabled her to clinch the 2023 Edusave Good Progress Award
and 2024 CJC Top Performer Award.</p>
<p>Charlotte’s strengths were also evident in her Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA), the CJC Oratorical Society. As a member of the Executive Committee
(Exco) – to be specific, the Secretary for the Model United Nations (MUN)
wing – Charlotte displayed admirable leadership while working with team
members who had differing viewpoints from her own. As she carried out her
Exco responsibilities, which included planning for CCA sessions and organizing
the 2024 CJ MUN, she learned the importance of being open to others' opinions
and was able to balance that with being proactive and decisive when the
situation called for it.</p>
<p>“Having the right mindset is … important. I think that it is important
to enjoy and take pride in the content that you are learning because that
can push you to want to do better. It is also important to remember that
examinations are not there to torture students, so rather than dreading
it, what I would encourage students to just see examinations as a way to
test their abilities and to learn more about how they can improve. Feeling
sad about doing badly is natural but what is done is done so it is most
important to pick yourself back up and learn from the experience.”</p>

<br><strong>CHEW CAVEN</strong>
</p>

who proposed a partnership between CJC and Hair for Hope (HfH) to raise
funds for Children Cancer Foundation in 2024.</p>
<p>Some advice for his juniors: “Burnout doesn’t help anyone, and sometimes,
taking a short break to listen to music or snack can make your study sessions
more productive. Study with friends, and ask each other questions to help
each other clear gaps in understanding that one might have missed by yourself.”</p>

person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With her empathetic and open ways of thinking, coupled with her outstanding
analytical skills, Chloe is driven to work for a better world as an educator.</p>
<p>“I would most definitely advise my juniors not to focus on how much you,
or others, have studied, but to focus on how much you have learnt or internalised
every time you revise.”</p>

closely with the beneficiary from the Singapore Association for the Visually
Handicapped to design an Inclusive Games Experience for students in CJC
to empathise with the challenges faced by visually-impaired individuals.</p>
<p>“My teachers have been instrumental in helping me grow as a person. They
have shown me how to broaden my horizon, view the world from different
perspectives and challenge myself to think critically. Beyond helping me
excel in my studies, they have helped me shape into a more confident, steadfast
and caring individual. I will always be grateful for the invaluable guidance

the shared laughter that lightened the load. These seemingly insignificant

<p>Some tips from Janelle: “Be aware with where you stand right now content-wise,
be aware with upcoming assignments and exams, and be even more aware of
how your current actions might potentially impact your future self. Start
with the little things (which are often overlooked), be good at them, and
that alone will greatly help your next steps in understanding the entire
syllabus. With that being said, it is also important to be intentional
about your study breaks; whether it is playing a sport or just doom scrolling
on social media, never let your surroundings faze you and be very clear
with what you want to achieve academically. ”</p>

Drive and Arduino Workshops, while also extending his expertise to teach
coding to primary school students at Bendemeer Primary School. His involvement
in prestigious competitions, including the International Mathematical Modelling
Competition and Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, further demonstrated
his passion for applying theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges.
As both MTL Representative and ICT Leader, he efficiently managed his responsibilities
while maintaining strong academic performance.</p>
<p>"I believe it would be my Secondary 2 teachers who believed in me and
pushed me hard to transfer laterally from NA to Express when I did not
believe that I could do it," Xuan Yu reflects gratefully. "Without their
support and guidance, I would not even have had the opportunity to go to
JC and would most probably have been set on going to poly instead." His
journey from NA to becoming a top performer at A-Levels stands as a testament
to his determination and growth mindset, serving as an inspiration to his
juniors.</p>

<p>Nathanael Sim Liheng's journey through Catholic Junior College has been
marked by outstanding leadership and a remarkable ability to balance diverse
interests. As a Home Tutorial Councillor, he demonstrated exceptional communication
skills and adaptability, effectively managing class activities and fostering
a harmonious environment among his peers. His academic pursuit of Economics,
Mathematics, and History was complemented by his active involvement in
various school activities, showcasing his ability to excel across different
domains.</p>
<p>A defining moment in Nathanael's CJC experience came through his unexpected
triumph at the Rockefella band competition. Despite initial doubts, his
leadership and dedication led his band to a unanimous victory from both
judges and students alike. This achievement, alongside his contributions
to the Tennis CCA where he served as a pillar of support for his teammates,
exemplifies his ability to thrive under pressure while maintaining strong
interpersonal connections. His commitment to fostering team spirit and
building meaningful relationships has been evident throughout his time
in both activities.</p>
<p>"I really want to thank Ms Charmaine, my History teacher, for being so
supportive in my academic journey throughout CJ," reflects Nathanael. "Even
outside of academics, she gave meaningful advice on managing studies and
relationships, which went a long way. I would also like to thank Ms Zhehui
Moo, my form teacher, who was extremely kind and accommodating to my class.
She taught us with much patience and love, and I really appreciate it."</p>

<p>Gao Zhijun's exceptional academic journey at Catholic Junior College has
been marked by numerous achievements and meaningful contributions to the
school community. A consistent performer who earned multiple spots on the
Principal's Honour Roll, Zhijun distinguished himself particularly in Economics,
where his passion led him to undertake H3 Economics at Singapore Management
University. His intellectual pursuits extended beyond the classroom through
various enrichment programmes, including the Physics Stretch Programme
and the Polaris Programme, where he honed his mathematical abilities. Notable
among his achievements was receiving the Best Speaker Certificate in the
Economics Multiplier Programme, demonstrating his exceptional grasp of
complex economic concepts.</p>
<p>As Home Tutorial Councillor and a member of the Oratorical Society, Zhijun
demonstrated exemplary leadership qualities and public speaking skills.
His involvement in service learning projects, particularly with the NTUC
Health Senior Citizen Program and the Singapore Association for the Visually
Handicapped, showcased his commitment to community service. Additionally,
his role as a student journalist for Zaobao allowed him to develop his
journalistic skills while engaging with the Chinese language and media
industry.</p>
<p>"I believe the most important tip is to apply the knowledge you learn
to your daily life," Zhijun shares, reflecting on his approach to learning.
"Make use of small pockets of time, like waiting for the bus or MRT, to
quickly revise or refresh your memory on certain concepts. To balance your
academic pursuits, I believe the best approach is to plan your day well,
which will prevent you from feeling overwhelmed."</p>

of resilience and dedication, marked by his strong academic performance
and deep appreciation for his support network. His commitment to excellence
was evident not only in his studies but also in his participation in enrichment
programmes, where he distinguished himself by winning Best Delegate at
the CJ Model United Nations. His strong interest in a legal career led
him to participate in both the Junior College Law Programme, and the Clyde
&amp; Co. Law Enrichment Programme in 2023, experiences that solidified
his professional ambitions.</p>
<p>As Captain of the Canoeing team, Danny demonstrated exceptional leadership
while achieving notable success in the 2024 National School Games Tournament,
securing 5th place in both the 500m and 1000m C1 events. His ability to
balance rigorous athletic training with academic demands showcased his
time management skills, while his participation in Rockafella 2024 revealed
his willingness to embrace new challenges. Through these diverse experiences,
Danny emerged as a well-rounded individual capable of excelling across
multiple domains while maintaining strong connections with his peers and
mentors.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, JC is a major balancing act and only with discipline in sticking
to a structured schedule and formation of good, consistent habits is it
then possible to maintain both a healthy mental state and do well in the
A levels."
