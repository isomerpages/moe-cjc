<p>Catholic Junior College celebrated a major milestone this year, hosting
its Homecoming Dinner on 30 May. The celebration saw our college welcome
back alumni from across the generations in honour of 50 years of faith,
friendships and fearless spirit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kicked off the festivities with the Homecoming Mass and Firebird Alumni
Networking session, followed by campus tours which evoked fond memories
for many returning graduates. After that, the celebrations moved to the
school field, which had been transformed into a lively open air venue,
complete with strobe lights, a stage and rows of dining tables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Homecoming Dinner featured an array of mouth watering food. Guests
enjoyed everything from the huge buffet spread to food vendors selling
cendol, Japanese takoyaki, satay and nacho cheese fries, just to name a
few, as well as CJ’s very own drinks bar. Throughout the evening, live
music and entertainment was provided by the school’s talented alumni bands
and emcees, keeping the spirits high.</p>
<p>Among the many highlights of the evening were the heartfelt conversations
had by alumni communities reunited with their friends, colleagues and students,
all sharing stories about their yesteryears in CJC, that really impacted
their lives for the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked whether they still kept in touch with their JC friends, it
was heartwarming to hear that most of them still did even after many decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One alumnus who was a part of CJ’s 15th student council stated that she,
“still [keeps] in contact with [her] council friends…has a group chat with
them and congratulates them on their birthdays.” Another remarked on the
joy of coming back to “meet friends and see how they changed after 40 years.”
When asked if they had any advice for graduating students, many emphasised
the importance of having a good community and strong friendships.</p>
<p>Our alumni also shared about numerous unforgettable experiences from their
days in CJC, many of which were about their time in CCAs or student council.
An alumnus from the Class of 1990, said that “JC changed [her] as she met
ppl from different walks of life” and the Student Council “challenged [her]
in terms of learning new skill sets.” An alumnus who used to be in the
college’s Rugby team also shared his experiences, saying that the team
faced many hurdles but “grew through the whole season” nonetheless.</p>
<p>One alumnus said that “whatever your experience [is] in JC is not a reflection
of your life,” and that life will continue to change. Another gave advice
on coping with the burden of school stress, stating that “it's okay to
cry,” and that “[the] teachers are amazing and genuinely willing to help…ask
for help when you need it.” Her words were a reminder that seeking support
is not a sign of weakness, but a step towards growth.</p>
<p>Despite the different walks of life that they came from, one thing was
in common: they all agreed CJC’s Homecoming Dinner celebrated not just
the school’s rich history, but also the life-long bonds that were forged
throughout the generations of students.&nbsp;</p>
