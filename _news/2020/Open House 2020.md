Our Open House on 14 January 2020 saw our community out in full force. Our students pulled their weight staging performances, co-leading micro-lessons, and more importantly, serving as ambassadors of CJC whilst interacting with our visitors as tour guides as well as CCA and stretch programme representatives. Showcasing the vibrant, student-led College life that is the hallmark of the CJC brand of education, our students testified to their experience of holistic education in CJC, the subject of the informative Principal’s Talks, micro-lessons and subject consultations conducted by our experienced tutors and School Leaders.&nbsp;

Our College community was also augmented by the generous contributions of our active alumni and Parent Support Group; making time to be present and converse with our visitors, they enlivened the atmosphere and lent credence to the College’s ethos of family. As we were once again reminded of our reasons why CJC is home, we were affirmed by our experiences of those new to the CJC family discovering their own reasons for making CJC the premier choice. We are hopeful that the new additions to the CJC family we’re so excited about - our incoming JC1s - will come to feel the same way!
