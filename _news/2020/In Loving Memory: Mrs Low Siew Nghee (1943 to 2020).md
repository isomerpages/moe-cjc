### **In Loving Memory - Mrs Low Siew Nghee (1943 - 2020)**

Mrs Low Siew Nghee was a beloved teacher and Vice Principal of Catholic Junior College (CJC) and we are sad to hear of her passing. A pioneer member of staff when CJC was established in 1975, Mrs Low spent 30 years in CJC – 13 years as a teacher for Geography and General Paper, and 17 years as Vice Principal. Mrs Low retired in CJC in 2005 and is fondly remembered by students and staff.

Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice Principal, said that Mrs Low was ‘a caring and motherly figure for both staff and students. She touched many lives as an educator and will be dearly missed.’

A person who enjoyed the company of others, she kept in touch with ex-colleagues and ex-students who became her friends over the years. Mdm Indra Ventrakam, HOD Economics, recounted that Mrs Low was an avid cook, ‘she loved inviting friends over to try her culinary specialties. She will always be remembered as a lady of strength and integrity.’

Mr Peter Thia, Senior Teacher (Mother Tongue Languages), shared that he considered himself lucky to have had Mrs Low as his mentor as she was able to provide a fresh perspective on the issues he was dealing with. ‘Her experiences with people allowed her to provide valuable insights into what I was facing with in my department. She gave me a lot of encouragement and support as I struggled to overcome adversities in my career,' he said.

In her tenure as Vice Principal, Mrs Low journeyed with students who had medical, financial and relational challenges with their peers and families. She found it most rewarding connecting with students, especially when they were touched in some way, through their interactions. Mrs Low would also advise teachers to be patient and caring and in time, be able to understand some of the challenges and difficulties their students faced in school and at home.

Her role models were long-serving educators. Apart from her parents, the founding principals of CJC – Bro Patrick Loh and Bro Joseph Kiely – instilled in her the highest standards of care for her charges. Believing firmly that every student can excel in life, Mrs Low would look for ways to help students do well and nurture them as they strive to succeed. Her hope also was for every CJCian, regardless of their backgrounds, to find some form of family in CJC and leave the college having forged that connection.

CJCians everywhere will miss Mrs Low – an unwavering figure of support, love and care for generations of students and staff. We pray that eternal rest be granted upon Mrs Low and God’s perpetual light shine upon her.

We send our deepest condolences to her family and loved ones.

Rest in peace, Mrs Low.
