CJC warmly welcomed the parents of our JC2s on 30 and 31 Jan 2020 during the Parents' Information Evening (PIE). As building valued partnerships with parents has long been viewed as critical to our students' success, the JC2 PIE was held to facilitate timely communication early in the A-Level year and enhance the preparedness of parents and students alike. 

Addressing the JC2 cohort and their parents, Vice-Principal Mrs Poon Wai Chin spoke about how a student's learning disposition, strength of character – and the positive impact these consequently have on academic achievement – ensures that the student is well-placed for entry into his or her choice of university and university course. With greater clarity on the end goal shared by parents, our JC2s, and the College, Mrs Poon appealed for their full support as the College has put into place extensive support structures for our JC2s during this pivotal stage of their education, including Education and Career Guidance counselling, routines for exam preparedness, and intensive revision plans targeted to the needs of our students. 

Thereafter, Mr Siva Krishnasamy, Parent Support Group (PSG) Chairperson, took to the stage to urge parents to take action and join existing PSG efforts such as preparing snacks for Night Study sessions, a College-initiative for independent study leading up to major internal examinations. The parents were then ushered to the respective homerooms where they met with their child's Home Tutor for conversations relating to the specific needs of each class or student. Overall, PIE was a timely reminder of the important tripartite alliance between parents, students, and the College.
