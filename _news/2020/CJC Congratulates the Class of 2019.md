### **CJC Congratulates the Class of 2019**

The Class of 2019 did themselves and Catholic Junior College (CJC) proud by achieving commendable results in the 2019 GCE A-Level examination.  The College continued to attain valued-added performance and commendable distinction rates in the various A-level subjects. Many students achieved their academic goals and will go on to apply for reputable universities and institutes of higher learning. 

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, congratulated the Class of 2019 on their good results and encouraged them to forge ahead to seize new learning opportunities, expand their horizons and continue their life journey as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart. During the release of the results on 21 Feb, Mrs Lim said, “the commendable results our Class of 2019 achieved is a culmination of two years of persistent effort and focus.  You worked hard not just at the individual level but as a team at class, CCA (co-curricular activity) and House level, helping each other to hone your strengths, overcome challenges and achieve your goals.  We are proud of your growth mindset, determination and sense of mission.  You were able to balance your academic, CCA, student leadership and service learning commitments well.  This is reflective of your desire to lead and serve in truth and love.” 

Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal/Student Development added, “our warmest congratulations to the Class of 2019 on your good results. May all of you continue to lead and serve with a positive impact on others wherever life takes you. Maintain your links with the College and CJC alumni. We welcome you back to CJC to guide and inspire your juniors and to support our various college programmes.  Once a CJCian, always a CJCian!” 

The College extends its heartfelt appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee and the alumni for the support, guidance and encouragement of the students throughout their educational journey in CJC. May God continue to bless our Class of 2019 with wisdom and grace as they take flight as Thinkers and Leaders.

The College congratulates and celebrates the academic and all other achievements of these outstanding CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and a Leader with a Heart.

**Aakash Dubey S/O Anil Kumar** <br>
Aakash is an intelligent, determined and conscientious individual. Throughout the two years he was in CJC, he applied critical thinking in his studies and consistently topped the class and cohort in many College examinations. With a strong aptitude for Mathematics and Science, it was unsurprising that he attained the A\*STAR Science Award in 2018 and had it extended for 2019. His stint at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology spurred on his passion in scientific research and development where he successfully completed the Student Research Attachment Programme. Recognised by the college for his outstanding academic performance, Aakash was awarded the Archbishop Scholarship in 2018 and 2019, one of the most prestigious scholarships CJC has to offer.

As the President of the Environmental Science Society, his Co-Curricular Activity, he oversaw the planning and execution of various projects and was a mentor to his juniors. With a genuine interest in environmental science, he was one of the delegates who represented Singapore at the Asean Plus Three Youth Environment Forum in 2018, organised by the National Environmental Agency. He learnt strategies to alleviate environmental issues such as climate change and created several innovative ideas at the Forum which were well-received. Highly motivated and unassuming, Aakash has a sincere dedication to excellence that would certainly serve him well in his future endeavours, including an aspiration to pursue Computer Science.

**Hew Zi Heng**<br>
Zi Heng is a rare gem who was able to manage his studies, co-curricular activities and other aspects of life exceptionally well. Zi Heng exuded a great sense of intrinsic motivation and this propelled him towards academic excellence by seeking out opportunities to learn and grow whenever he could. He was the proud recipient of the Singapore Police Force (SPF) Book Prize in 2019. The SPF Book Prize is awarded to students with excellence academic results, strong leadership in their CCAs and have made significant contributions to the community.

Besides participating in numerous Model United Nations and other notable conferences since secondary school and continuing to do so at the JC level, Zi Heng also offered his service as an emcee at school events even though this meant long rehearsals after school. As President of the Oratorical Society, Zi Heng made the effort to understand his members well and would always motivate and encourage them to perform to their maximum potential. He led his club with the firm belief that the process and people are as important as the outcome.

Keen to give back to society and to learn from more life lessons, Zi Heng participated in an academic immersion and service learning trip to India in 2018. Zi Heng was also an active volunteer during his spare time, taking part in activities such as the Citi-YMCA Youth for Causes Programme where he gained invaluable experiences interacting with various groups in the community. Zi Heng truly internalised the growth mindset and made it his own.

**Ng Le Yang, Owen**<br>
Owen is a perceptive and keen learner who strives to maintain high standards in all subjects, and consistently produced work of a commendable standard. He showed his great capacity for analytical and logical thought, raising intelligent questions in class and seeking opportunities to learn independently. He balanced his studies with non-academic pursuits such as participating in an Outward Bound Singapore land and sea expedition, and representing the college in the National School Games for Canoeing and National Junior Canoeing Championships, where he displayed strength, resilience and sportsmanship. Owen also served his College community; with his outgoing personality and strong interpersonal skills, he was selected to be Orientation Group Leader and Assistant Faction Head for the JC1 Orientation. He was also instrumental in fostering class unity as Pastoral Care Councillor, putting his charisma and persuasive leadership to good use in order to rally the support of his class. Furthermore, Owen also showed his care for the wider community through his active participation in a class-initiated Service Learning Project focusing on children with special needs.

**Yee Mon Tun**<br>
Mon Tun has the grit and determination to give her best once she sets her mind on a goal. Determined to learn beyond the confines of the classroom, she broadened her understanding of various subjects by making the most of learning opportunities and trips organised by CJC, including the Ignite Residential Programme as well as the REACH Cambridge and Vietnam academic trips. Mon Tun was also a dedicated member of the Drama Society and conducted extensive research on the character she took on for an in-house production. Beyond acting, she explored her interest in theatre by taking on the role of stage manager for the Drama Society production during CJ Celebrates. On top of her contributions at the College level, she also gave back to society, focusing in particular on young persons and the elderly.

**Papattarada Apithanangsiri**<br>
Papattarada is a resilient and independent learner who required minimal structured guidance from her tutors. She possesses the mental agility to grasp and apply concepts easily and synthesise information, producing high quality work that earned her consistent placing on the Principal’s Honour Roll for internal examinations. She also represented CJC in numerous competitions, such as the American Mathematics Competition and Singapore Mathematical Olympiad, where she won various accolades that are a testament to her keen mind. With the initiative and enthusiasm to apply her learning to authentic contexts, Papattarada took up a work attachment stint with the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management at the National University of Singapore, where she had the opportunity to gain first-hand experiences in Data Sciences.

A creative individual, Papattarada was a committed member in the college Choir. Her passion for this art form motivated her to train intensively and she represented CJC at the Singapore Youth Festival in 2019; CJC eventually clinched the Certificate of Distinction. As Section Leader, she brought out the best in her members and led by example. Her amicability and sincerity allow her to enjoy good rapport with her peers and teachers, and win their trust and support.

**Joshua James Chong**<br>
Joshua is a well-rounded individual who epitomised excellence in both the academic and extra-curricular aspects of College life. For his all-rounded achievement in both his studies and sports, he was awarded the Flame Scholarship in 2018 and 2019. Joshua was also a recipient of the Peter Lim Scholarship in 2018, which is awarded to high-performing athletes. Balancing academic rigour with his commitment to diving training, he was in the pool 5 to 7 times a week during competitive seasons. He represented Singapore at the 18th Asian Games, and also overcame injury to clinch second place in the Mixed 3 meter synchronized event at the 10th Singapore National Diving Championships in 2019. Additionally, his sporting prowess in diverse sports helped him to win the confidence of his team in Football, his Co-Curricular Activity. He joined the sport in his second year in the College but was a pivotal member of the team, role-modelling for his peers a spirit of excellence, resilience, and conscientiousness throughout the tough training sessions.

Well-liked by his peers, Joshua also stood out for his integrity and character. He was entrusted with the class funds as Treasurer, and his easy-going demeanour brought life and humour to the classroom. His positive influence on those around him cannot be understated; his refusal to shy away from challenges which some may deem insurmountable, and the effort to give his utmost best in whatever he does, is an inspiration to his peers and teachers alike.

**Lee Weng Heng, Jon**<br>
Jon pursued excellence in his studies and displayed an eagerness to explore different strategies to make his learning more effective. He made good progress and achieved a commendable standard in all his subjects, but continued to strive to outdo himself. Jon’s intellectual curiosity drove him to look beyond the GCE A-Level curriculum to learn authentically. As he is reliable and sincere, his peers looked to him for support and saw him as a role model, as evinced from him being unanimously nominated for the Edusave Character Award in 2019.

Jon sought an active and balanced life in CJC, serving as the Secretary of the Environmental Science Society, his Co-Curricular Activity. In the process, he attended the Singapore Environmental Action and Leadership Programme organised by Yale-NUS College, which challenged his assumptions about environmentalism and broadened his perspective of environmental sustainability. Besides, his compassion towards others and sense of community involvement grew in the course of his efforts to serve the wider community; in a class-based Service Learning Project (SLP), he worked with the Catholic Aids Response Effort, and attended the Ignite Residential Programme held at the National University of Singapore’s University Town to pitch and present proposals that address the concerns of the stakeholders he came into contact with during his class SLP. Jon was also selected to be part of an Overseas Service Learning Project to Vietnam, where he did much heavy lifting in terms of manual labour to construct tiling for a school, on top of teaching English and Mathematics to the local children.

**Ronan Siah**<br>
Ronan genuinely enjoys learning for its own sake; his eagerness to learn was evident in the classroom, where he drove discussions conducive for learning and frequently sought deeper understanding of issues and concepts in a cross-disciplinary manner. For instance, during the Geographical Investigation Field Trip to Kuantan, Malaysia, his efforts saw him and his group give presentations that showed the ability to make complex connections between theory and practice. Always keen to explore new learning opportunities, Ronan was accepted into the Singapore Convention on Mediation internship programme in 2019 where he served as a youth ambassador to foreign delegates, and he also participated in a competition organised by the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), the SUSS Analytics and Visualization Challenge 2019. His team emerged third in the pre-tertiary and tertiary education division.

As the 2019 CJC Arts Valedictorian, his stellar academic performance was balanced with his active contributions to his community and society at large. A passionate advocate for environmental sustainability, he served as Publicity Head of his Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), Environmental Science Society, organising publicity efforts to rally his cohort’s support for various environmental programmes initiated by the CCA, including Earth Day events and the collaboration with the Public Utilities Board Singapore to raise awareness on water conservation issues. He was awarded the Harvard Prize Book (Singapore) 2019/20 award as a testament to his efforts to inspire others to care for the environment and volunteer in the community.

Beyond school commitments, Ronan also participated in external community service programmes such as educating the children on a local heritage tour as part of the Youth Corps Singapore, and raising funds for Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Young Men’s Christian Association Flag Day. He also frequently volunteered at his secondary school as senior trainer in the National Police Cadet Corps Unit, to train and develop new cadet leaders. Overall, Ronan’s strong values and principles in life guides his decisions and actions, and he embodies the College’s ethos of mission-centred, sustainable service to the wider community.

**Stacy Lee Sze Ying**<br>
Stacy’s commitment to her academic studies paid off with her excellent results at the GCE A-Level examinations in 2019. The epitome of a diligent student, Stacy would set clear goals and devise detailed plans with deadlines to achieve them. This enabled her to cope with the A-Level curriculum remarkably well and her intellectual promise was further recognized when she became the only student in the College to pursue two subjects at the H3 level.

As the Vice-President of the Oratorical Society, Stacy modelled the belief of doing what she expects others to do. She set high standards for her members to achieve and put into practice her strong organizational skills by skilfully organizing others to help the Oratorical Society reach greater heights. One of Stacy's numerous accolades was being one of only two students selected from all the junior colleges in Singapore to be part of a debate panel in The Straits Times' Education Forum in April 2019.

A Thinker with a Mission and a Leader with a Heart, Stacy reached out to her friends and often spent her breaks revising her work with them, exchanging pointers and ways to improve, consolidate and enhance their learning.

**Pranav Ghosh**<br>
Pranav approaches challenges with enthusiasm, seeing them as opportunities for learning and growth. This has no doubt contributed to his steady academic improvement.  He also stood out as a confident and articulate speaker. Coupled with his passion for public speaking, he was a formidable opponent in the various competitions he participated in. In the 2018 Plain English Speaking Award (PESA) competition, he was one of the top seven speakers in the nation for the JC/Institute of Technical Education (ITE)/Polytechnic category. Additionally, in the 2018 Model United Nations and the 2019 Future Economic Forum, he was named Outstanding Delegate twice, and recognised for Best Diplomacy and Negotiation in the former.

Pranav’s leadership ability was also honed when he stepped up as Social Welfare Officer in the Executive Committee of his Co-Curricular Activity, Oratorical Society. This was on top of his role as Sports Leader in his class. More importantly, even in the absence of a leadership role or title, Pranav applied himself meaningfully to his class’ Service Learning Project, which was focused on the elderly. Though he initially faced challenges in communicating with the elderly patients as most of them spoke Mandarin, his creative use of gestures and sincerity to serve won them over.

_In Veritate et Caritate_

The college sends her warmest congratulations to the following students on their sterling performance at the 2019 GCE A-Level examinations.
