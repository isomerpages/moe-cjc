The Class of 2019 did themselves and Catholic Junior College (CJC) proud by achieving commendable results in the 2019 GCE A-Level examination.  The College continued to attain valued-added performance and commendable distinction rates in the various A-level subjects. Many students achieved their academic goals and will go on to apply for reputable universities and institutes of higher learning. 

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, congratulated the Class of 2019 on their good results and encouraged them to forge ahead to seize new learning opportunities, expand their horizons and continue their life journey as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart. During the release of the results on 21 Feb, Mrs Lim said, “the commendable results our Class of 2019 achieved is a culmination of two years of persistent effort and focus.  You worked hard not just at the individual level but as a team at class, CCA (co-curricular activity) and House level, helping each other to hone your strengths, overcome challenges and achieve your goals.  We are proud of your growth mindset, determination and sense of mission.  You were able to balance your academic, CCA, student leadership and service learning commitments well.  This is reflective of your desire to lead and serve in truth and love.” 

Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal/Student Development added, “our warmest congratulations to the Class of 2019 on your good results. May all of you continue to lead and serve with a positive impact on others wherever life takes you. Maintain your links with the College and CJC alumni. We welcome you back to CJC to guide and inspire your juniors and to support our various college programmes.  Once a CJCian, always a CJCian!” 

The College extends its heartfelt appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee and the alumni for the support, guidance and encouragement of the students throughout their educational journey in CJC. May God continue to bless our Class of 2019 with wisdom and grace as they take flight as Thinkers and Leaders.

The College congratulates and celebrates the academic and all other achievements of these outstanding CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and a Leader with a Heart.
