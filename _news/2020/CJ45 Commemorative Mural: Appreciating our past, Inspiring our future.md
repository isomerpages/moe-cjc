### **CJ45 Commemorative Mural - Appreciating our past. Inspiring our future**

Written by: Ray Anne Ng (1T01), and Elena Choong (1T24)

##### **require school to upload video to youtube**

A special mural to celebrate CJC's 45th anniversary was conceptualised and painted by Dr Felicia Low (Class of 1994) with contributions from the JC1 and JC2 students, members of staff as well as the school's management. 

Dr Low, an award-winning practising artist and alumna, conceptualised the CJ45 mural to signify the iconic symbols of our college - the Flame and the Holy Spirit. The collective, yet diverse individual tiles that connect to a main branch symbolises the shared gratitude towards the CJ family. It is our hope that this mural will inspire the current and future batches of CJ teachers and students to be guided by the light of the Holy Spirit to fulfil their hopes and dreams.
