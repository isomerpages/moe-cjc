<p>Catholic Junior College (CJC) will celebrate the 50th anniversary of her founding in 2025. The CJ50 Anniversary Fundraising Campaign aims to raise a target of $524,000 to develop a Student Learning and Recreational Hub and a Heritage Gallery. These enhanced spaces will enable new and engaging learning experiences for current and future CJCians, as well as connect them to the history of the college.</p><p>In the event that the funds collected are more than the amount needed for the development of the Student Learning and Recreational Hub and Heritage Gallery, the excess funds would be used for other educational purposes approved by the Ministry of Education. We thank donors for their kindness and generosity in support of our cause.</p><p>Click on the link below to donate!</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.giving.sg/organisation/profile/961a755e-ec67-417c-94a8-a3d28089dc5c</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>In Veritate et Caritate</em></p>
