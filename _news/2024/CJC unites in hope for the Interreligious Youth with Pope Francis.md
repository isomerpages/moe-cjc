<p>Catholic Junior College (CJC) is privileged to be the host venue for the
Interreligious Youth with Pope Francis organised by the Ministry of Community,
Culture and Youth and the Catholic Archdiocese, to be attended by youths
from various institutions and of different faiths, on 13 September.</p>
<p>In the preparation for this encounter, students from CJC were encouraged
to reflect on their roles as champions of interreligious harmony, building
unity and hope in solidarity with others outside their own religion. Students
and staff held discussions to share their views, folded doves and wrote
their pledge of commitment to interreligious harmony as part of an art
installation.</p>

<p>Commenting on the discussions, Noor Aaliyah Ford, a Muslim student, said
that it was a platform for her to delve deeper into her faith and challenge
herself to find out why she believes in her faith so much. She added that
in a multi-religious and multi-cultural society like Singapore’s, it is
important to have a sense of respect when interacting with each other.</p>

<p>Kavenesh Manivannan, a Hindu student, shared that “it is a great opportunity
to learn from various viewpoints and connect with people from different
faiths. Events like these can help build understanding and respect, which
are crucial for promoting harmony.” He added that the communal batik piece
and the art installation ‘Wings of Unity and Hope’ created by CJCians will
show the Pope our commitment towards unity and “it is an important part
that the Singaporean youth will play in building a future that is grounded
in peace and mutual respect.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ng Pei Ling, a Buddhist and one of the students who put up the dove
installation artwork, said that she would “engage in respectful dialogue
with peoples of different faiths, participate in interreligious events
in school, and encourage understanding within my family and community.”
She hopes to build stronger and more inclusive relationships through dialogue
and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CJ Community came together to paint a batik art piece depicting the
major religions in Singapore. His Holiness, Pope Francis, will paint the
final strokes with four students from Catholic Junior College and two others
from St Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School during the interreligious
youth meeting with Pope Francis on 13 September. Mrs Woo Soo Min, Principal,
CJC, noted that the journey of preparation has been a humbling experience
of “encountering one’s own faith and understanding of others’.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jeremiah Ng, a Catholic student, said that “with all the anticipation
and curiosity, I would like to see what Pope Francis has to say about the
state of the world's inter-religious harmony and how I can promote such
harmony in action and thought in school and the world.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;Echoing the thoughts of many, Isaac Tan, a student who professes
a belief in Taoism, said that “contributing to the batik painting allows
me to contribute to something much larger. It is an honour to be part of
something that not only celebrates our differences but also brings us together
in a shared vision of peace and humanity.”&nbsp;</p>
