<p>There was a palpable sense of warmth in the passing on of the legacy of
leadership, as the JC2 student leaders were celebrated for their remarkable
contributions. Their achievements were a source of immense pride for the
entire college community, serving as a testament to the value servant leadership.
Simultaneously, the atmosphere was charged with hope and excitement as
the JC1 student leaders embarked on their journey, eager to embrace their
new roles and make their mark on the college.</p>
