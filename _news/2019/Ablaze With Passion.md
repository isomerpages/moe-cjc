#### **Hearts Ablaze: One Flame, One Family!**
Ablaze! 2019 celebrated the many talents of the CJC family. Throughout the month, we recognised the dedication and achievements of all our CCAs. A student-led initiative spearheaded by the Student Council, Ablaze! 2019 used various platforms, including social media, to affirm all CCAs for the opportunities they afford for enlivening College life and promoting student development.  

Ablaze! 2019 called for stories from all CCAs and their enthusiastic responses were warmly received by the College community, facilitating greater understanding of and support for the diverse CCA groups that are indispensable to CJCâ€™s vibrant and inclusive school culture. In particular, the College community rallied round the teams representing CJC at inter-school competitions such as the National School Games and the Singapore Youth Festival (Arts Presentation). Much love and support was shown via social media, notes of encouragement, and personal visits to cheer on the teams at their competition venues, and in return, the competing teams impressed with their drive for excellence.  

Our passion for the beliefs and values the CJC community stands for has been set alight by Ablaze! 2019, so that it can continue to burn brightly in all other aspects of our CJC journey. Hearts Ablaze: One Flame, One Family!
