_“You’re on this broad journey of life. All these things that you do are just steps you take to get to the best version of yourself. Don’t be fazed by doing badly - there is no shame in encountering burnouts or hitting the wall. Don’t let one bad result get you down. Pick yourself up and carry on.”_

He dreams of contributing to the academic world through research and development in the area of Chemistry.  
  
_“During my time in CJ, I realised that there are many students who underestimate their potential and as a result, do not work hard enough to achieve their goals. So, to the juniors - do not get affected by your shortcomings but take ownership of your learning and push yourself to do better. Prioritise your learning over things that may not necessarily be important and then focus on your studies fully.”_

_“Go for consultations with your friends. It helps a lot because each friend does different things so you learn from your friends too. We benefit from learning and helping each other and ultimately, we want everyone to do well together. Moreover, know what you want and stick with that end in mind. When challenges come your way, always keep your end goal in mind.”_

**Isaac Soh**<br>
Isaac exhibited the best qualities one has come to associate with a CJCian: responsible, disciplined, caring. Not only was Isaac an exemplary student in the classroom, he demonstrated his commitment to a holistic education by pursuing his love of nature with the Environmental Science Society, eventually helming it as their President. During his tenure, he organised various recycling projects such as the Cross-Country Recycling Project as well as a week-long newspaper collection and environmental awareness programme during Earth Week. His teachers selected him for the Singapore Environmental Action and Leadership (SEAL) Programme at Yale-NUS College because of his knowledge and eagerness to learn about environmental issues. In all the endeavours Isaac undertook, he was never one to be daunted by the scale or the challenge of the task ahead. This included an Overseas Service Learning Programme trip to Vietnam where he and his teammates helped to construct a playground at a school in rural Vietnam. Isaac has a calm demeanor and is a thoughtful individual who is observant and sensitive to the needs of others.    
  
“_CJC has platforms like the Leadership Training Camp which helped me learn how to be a good leader for my CCA. My teachers were always there for me and made time for me whenever I had questions and doubts. So I would say that the teachers and staff were the most important support system I had._”

Ever helpful and optimistic, Tiffany always went the extra mile to help her classmates in their work.    
  
“_I think it is very important to have something to ground you no matter what your religion is and have friends to speak with, especially when you are very stressed. My faith has helped me a lot in my CJ journey and I was able to use my talents to serve God and the school._”

**Elizabeth Wee**<br>
Elizabeth’s focus, determination and capacity for criticality of thought demonstrated in her time in college was only rivalled by her tenacity in making the most of her CJC experience. Elizabeth adopted a holistic approach towards college life, having been President of the college’s Symphonic Band, wherein her exemplary leadership, self-discipline, and charisma were crucial in guiding her band towards a spirit of excellence. Elizabeth also served in the Music Ministry as a vocalist and an instrumentalist in school masses and important College events. Elizabeth was an Orientation Group Leader which further developed her sense of commitment in the arduous preparation for Orientation week. Her compassion towards others was seen in her participation in the 2017 Overseas Service Learning Project in Vietnam, a seven-day community involvement program, where, elected as the Second In-Charge, she contributed greatly to the project to make a positive difference in the lives of the children. She managed the team in the preparation and execution of the games, lessons, physical work activities, and was a crucial factor in the team’s success. While juggling the rigour of academic demands, she also rallied her class to perform during Literary Evening 2018 and she was the Director, Scriptwriter and main cast member. Their performance won ‘Best Production’ that year. She received the Edusave Character Award in 2017 and 2018 in recognition of her exemplary discipline and character, and is a model of the school’s values throughout and beyond her academic journey. Elizabeth’s gentle spirit and appreciation for beauty and the arts has only complemented her relentless drive for holistic development and she truly exemplifies a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart. She is proof that it is indeed possible to pursue your artistic passions and to balance it with a consistent focus on the academic journey.    
  
“_It was amazing how everyone was able to leave everything behind in Singapore, like the stress from school, as well as other personal problems, and just immerse themselves in the OSLP experience. It allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and helped me to become a better and more compassionate person. My OSLP experience played a significant role in improving my leadership skills as well._”
