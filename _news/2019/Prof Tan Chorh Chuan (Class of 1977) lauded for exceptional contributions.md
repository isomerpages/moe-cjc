<u>About the NUS Outstanding Service Award</u><br>
NUS conferred the prestigious Outstanding Service Award on two accomplished individuals who have made exceptional contributions towards the development of the University, Singapore and the international community.

<u>Professor Tan Chorh Chuan</u><br>
Prof Tan Chorh Chuan is the Executive Director of the Office for Healthcare Transformation and Chief Health Scientist at MOH. Trained as a renal physician, he made a phenomenal transition to a visionary leader, and carved a distinguished career with stellar achievements. A Public Service Commission scholar, Prof Tan studied medicine at NUS and subsequently received his doctorate in Singapore. In 1997, at the age of 38, he became the youngest faculty to be appointed Dean of the then NUS Faculty of Medicine for three years. He served as Director of Medical Services, MOH, from 2000 to 2004, where he was responsible for leading the public health response to the 2003 SARS epidemic. 

As the inaugural Chief Executive of the National University Health System in 2008, he brought the NUS schools of medicine, dentistry and public health, as well as the National University Hospital, under a single governance.

Under his stewardship as NUS President from 2008 to 2017, the University’s reputation as a leading global university with an Asian perspective rose to new heights. NUS made remarkable progress in the areas of education, research and entrepreneurship – from adopting new models of teaching and learning such as NUS University Town and Yale-NUS College, to accelerating the pace of multidisciplinary research as well as entrepreneurship initiatives. 

Prof Tan was Deputy Chairman of Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research from 2004 to 2017, and Chair of the World Economic Forum’s Global University Leaders Forum from 2014 to 2016. He is also the first Singaporean to be elected as an international member of the US National Academy of Medicine in 2015.
