### **Open House 2019: Ignite, Illuminate, Inspire!**
Open House 2019 was held on 15 January from 10am to 4pm, the day after the release of the O-Level results. CJC was alive with the sounds of “Welcome to CJ!” as the welcome committee enthusiastically greeted future CJCians. Although Open House 2019 was held on a weekday (Tuesday), the College saw a steady stream of prospective students and their parents wanting to discover the CJ experience. Upon registering at the booth, visitors were given a goodie bag filled with mementoes and information about the college.

Our Principal, Mrs Phyllis Lim, held talks in the library to share about the history of the school and its motto, ‘In Veritate et Caritate’. Apart from answering questions from visitors, she took the opportunity to share with them CJC’s unique programmes such as the Ignite Programme, and the English Language and Linguistics Programme, of which visitors were particularly keen on.

Micro-lessons were conducted by the teaching staff to introduce prospective students to the various subjects offered by the College such as H2 English Language and Linguistics, H2 Knowledge and Inquiry, H2 Economics and H2 Chemistry. Curious guests were able to interact with the school leaders and teaching staff at the Performing Arts Centre (PAC) to find out more about the subject combinations and classes. Some booths, such as the Ignite Programme, even had JC2 students sharing their personal experiences on how they themselves had been shaped by the “CJC experience”.

The campus was in high spirits with dynamic performances by the different performing arts co-curricular activities (CCA) groups such as Dance, Guzheng, Band and Choir. Visitors were guided around the college and viewed different booths that displayed the various co-curricular activities and opportunities CJC has to offer, as current students enthusiastically showcased a taster of student life. Amongst them were the Overseas Service Learning Project (OSLP) and academic trips that come under the Stretch Programmes, part of the college’s signature range of leadership opportunities. Flash mobs were also conducted by the students leaders and the exuberance shown by them exemplified the vibrant CJC culture. One of the highlights of the CCA presentations was the Drama production, Home. It is an emotion-fuelled play that centres around two elderly men - played by members of the drama club - in an elder care home and the bittersweet memories they carry.

CJC’s Open House 2019 was a great success and allowed prospective students to feel the spark of what their lives as a CJCian could be like.
