Former Chairman of the Catholic Junior College School Management Committee (CJC SMC), Mr Gerard Lee, was awarded the “Best of the Best Lifetime Achievement Award (Asean region)” by Asia Asset Management journal, a pensions and investment journal, on 9 May 2019. Mr Lee, Chairman of the CJC SMC from 2009 to 2016, was honoured for his illustrious career spanning three decades. Before his role as the Chief Executive Officer for Lion Global Investors in 2010 to date, Mr Lee was the Chief Investment Officer at Temasek’s Fund Management Division and the Chief Executive of Fullerton Fund Management.

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal, CJC, congratulated Mr Lee on behalf of the School Management Committee. “It was heartening to read about your efforts to make accessible products typically available to the wealthy, to the man-in-the-street.  This is a proud moment for you and the CJ community.”

Mr Gerard Lee has been a most committed alumnus of our college over the years. He belonged to the class of 1977 in CJC, returned to serve the college as a member of the SMC in 1999 and became the first alumnus to be the Chairman of our SMC from 2009 to 2016.

Under Mr Lee’s leadership, CJC was transformed with the refreshing of the college crest, the college flag and the new college mission statement, Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart, in 2013. In spite of his busy work schedule, Mr Lee devoted many hours over the years chairing SMC meetings to guide CJC to prepare for the future. Many initiatives were carried out to tap on the experiences, connections and other resources of our alumni for the benefit of our students as for the first time, alumni matters were placed under the ambit of the SMC. A variety of events for our alumni was carried out annually under Mr Lee’s guidance such as re-union dinners, annual golf days, sports fiestas and 50th birthday gatherings to re-connect alumni with the college. Other major initiatives included the launching of the Archbishop and the Flame Scholarships, fund raising for the building of the college chapel and to cap it all, Mr Lee spearheaded the college’s 40th Anniversary Celebrations in 2015 and the production of the coffee table book that honours forty of our many distinguished alumni who represent our college values and are thinkers with a mission and leaders with a heart.

Besides his contributions to CJC, Mr Lee is a governor of the St Gabriel Foundation. He is also a proud father of two daughters and a son. His daughters, Amelia and Eugenia Lee, both chose to study in CJC and served in the Student Council. Amelia and Eugenia have followed in their father’s footsteps to work in banking and finance, and Amelia has become the co-founder and managing partner of a private equity fund.

As a CJCian, a corporate leader and a father, Mr Lee truly exemplifies a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.
