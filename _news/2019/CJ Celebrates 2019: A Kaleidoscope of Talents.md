As a staple of the school calendar, CJ Celebrates was held on 6 June 2019 with much fanfare. The highly decorated stars of the event, CJC’s performing arts CCAs, all boasted the achievement of the Certificate of Distinction, the highest possible at the 2019 Singapore Youth Festival (Arts Presentation). The heightened expectation of the performances by the musicians, dancers and thespians amongst us had the College community in a celebratory mood and eager to witness the&nbsp;_Kaleidoscope of Talents_&nbsp;the performers had to offer, which bear testament to their consummate skill and diligence.

Several invited guests also graced the event, in line with CJC’s ethos of family and service to the community. The ever-supportive alumni was well-represented by&nbsp;Chan Wei En from the class of 2009, alumnus of the CJC Choir. Wei En holds a Masters of Music in Voice Performance from New England Conservatory, and having much experience performing before judges and choral enthusiasts alike both locally and internationally, his solo performance elevated the afternoon’s performances to a different class. Just as importantly, one of CJC’s beneficiaries, St Luke’s ElderCare, was warmly welcomed at the event and they thoroughly enjoyed it. It was heartening to see how the CJC has forged sustained connections with its various partners in order to enliven College life and bring about a lasting impact on the community.

At the close of the concert, the Symphonic Band led the performing arts groups to sing and sway to the&nbsp;tune of&nbsp;_This Is Me_, an iconic song from the movie,&nbsp;_The Greatest Showman_. It was a fitting end, as the performers truly lived out the lyrics in the course of preparing for the SYF and CJ Celebrates: “I am brave, I am bruised; I am who I’m meant to be, this is me.” We praise and thank God for providing His grace and strength for all the performing arts CCAs and their teachers and coaches.
