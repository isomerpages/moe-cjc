Top Performing Science Class of 2020 -Â **2T32**, with their Home Tutor, Mr Alvin Leong (standing at the back of the class).  
  
Though 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges brought about by Covid-19, the Class of 2020 did themselves and the College proud and achieved excellence at the 2020 GCE A-Level examinations. CJC continued to achieve commendable distinctions in different A-Level subjects, maintaining value-adding performance of our students. The College is proud to have many CJCians realising their aspirations and qualifying for institutes of higher learning both locally and overseas.  
  
Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, congratulated the Class of 2020 on their good results. She said, "your cohort had to contend with unforeseen key challenges such as full home-based learning, but you demonstrated determination, resilience, teamwork and class spirit to overcome these challenge and achieve commendable results. We salute you for remaining steadfast in the midst of challenges and for never losing sight of your goals and aspirations". Besides achieving good academic results, she noted that many students were able to juggle their academic, CCA, leadership and community service commitments as well as provide care and support for their classmates during challenging times. This reflected their all-round leadership development. She urged the Class of 2020 to continue learning, leading and serving as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.  
  
Mrs Poon Wai Chin, Vice-Principal/Academic added, "our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2020 on your good results. We know that the human spirit is always stronger and more resilient than we think, and your results have proven that. The relentless desire to excel and reach out drives us to never settle for second best, but to keep going, looking out for each other as we do so. I wish you the very best in life as you continue to find ways to serve and lead with heart and passion."  
  
The College extends its heartfelt appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee and the alumni for the support, guidance and encouragement of the students throughout their educational journey in CJC. May God continue to bless our Class of 2020 with wisdom and grace as they take flight as Thinkers and Leaders and make a positive impact on society. The College celebrates the outstanding achievements of the following CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart.

**Karel Nareswara Devananda**  
  
Karel has always been fascinated by language and its impact on the world, and the study of language has been an enlightening and electrifying world for him. Besides his passion for the arts, the awards Karel received in 2019 affirm his rigour of thought in both the Arts and Science subjects. These accolades include: Top Overall Performer of the JC1 cohort at the Mid-Year Examinations and Year-end Promotional Examinations, Top Performer in ELL (Mid-Year Examination and Promotional Examination) as well as Mathematics (Promotional Examination).  
  
The trust that his tutors have in Karel's sense of responsibility and self-management is also seen in his being selected for the Overseas History Academic Trip to Vietnam in 2019 and the English REACH-Cambridge trip in 2020, though the latter was cancelled due to the pandemic. In 2019, he also represented CJC in ministerial talks such as the S Rajaratnam Lecture and leadership conferences such as the St. Joseph's Institution Convention and the Catholic Education Conference. As an intuitively reflective leader, Karel thinks deeply about his contributions to the Student Council, and actively seeks opportunities for self-improvement and the improvement of the CCA. He exceeded the expectations for a Vice-President, and his influence has gained him a strong following with his peers, who respect him for his guidance and regard him as a role model of effective leadership.  
  
_"Always persevere and know that there are people around who will support you - your friends, your peers and your teachers. Keep pushing on and never give up."_

**Tan Yi Ping, Zoe**  
  
Zoe is a vocal and energetic student well-suited for CJC's talent development programme, the Ignite programme. It nurtured curiosity and a mindset of challenging conventional ways of doing things. Zoe has also developed greater independence as she frequently had to conduct self-directed research for in-class presentations.  
  
Zoe was also a member of the Guitar Ensemble, where she served as a Section Leader. Throughout her time in office, Zoe focused on building trust between members and forging meaningful relationships so that the whole ensemble could perform well together. For their efforts, the team attained a Distinction for the Singapore Youth Festival (Arts Presentation) in 2019. Zoe always took up opportunities to stretch herself and to serve others, and to this end, she joined other student activities in CJC. This includes a second Co-Curricular Activity, Music Ministry, and she also participated in planning Genesis sessions, a platform for students of CJC to remain in touch with their faith. As a Catholic, Zoe also readily volunteered in events such as volunteering at the Church of St Ignatius for Catholic Education Sunday, and helped out during the Commencement of School Year Mass.  
  
Zoe also took part in the Work Attachment and Shadowing Programme during her time at CJC, working in hospitality at Serena Spa in Marriott Hotel. By interacting with the therapists, she observed how their work relieved stress and pain for their clients. This opportunity dovetailed with Zoe's aspiration to pursue further education in the healthcare sector.  
  
_"My teachers gave their time willingly to provide academic consultations. Spiritual support in CJ provided me with the strength to do well. As a student of the Ignite Programme, I found that learning was new and interesting every day, which sparked a passion for learning for me through lessons that stretched our potential." _

**Wo Junwei, Darryl**  
  
Darryl is an independent, compassionate learner who welcomes feedback and is able to think critically. He is open to criticism and is able to turn it into motivation for future self-improvement. Darryl chose the unconventional path of repeating his first year in junior college, demonstrating astute self-awareness, and this decision was pivotal in helping him achieve academic excellence. He went on to receive the Principal's Honour Roll Award for the 2019 Mid-Year Examination and 2019 Promotional Examination.  
  
Darryl juggled his academic commitments and sporting ambitions. He was elected the Vice-Captain of CJC's Floorball team in 2018, and he was also elected to be an Executive Committee member of another Floorball club, Blacks Salibandy. Besides his focus on self-development, he is also committed to helping others. Apart from the class Local Service Learning Project with Catholic Aids Response Effort and the National Heritage Board, he was also selected for the Overseas Service Learning Programme to Chiang Mai. He was appointed Team Welfare Head and Safety Leader for the trip due to the passion and meticulousness he demonstrated during the pre-trip group meetings. In 2020, Darryl also volunteered to be an Orientation Group Leader and he showed resilience when the programme was overhauled to adhere to new social distancing rules.  
  
_"I found the motivation to study hard despite the personal challenges that I faced. When I had to revisit JC1, I became more driven to perform well academically. I helped my friends to bridge gaps in their learning and revised consistently." _

**Steffi Lim En Qi**  
  
Steffi is a self-directed and goal-oriented learner. Adaptable to changing circumstances, she is not easily daunted by difficulty. She keeps her targets in mind and works towards them with diligence and determination.  
  
In her Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), Tennis, she was observed to be nurturing and charitable towards her teammates, often investing her time to take care of their well-being. Although she did not take on an official leadership role in the CCA, she played no small part in motivating the team to give their best in training sessions and tournaments. This leadership ability was also evident in her role as Assistant Home Tutorial Councillor (AHTC) of her class. As AHTC, Steffi recognised and appreciated the strengths and contributions of her peers, and prioritized serving the needs of the class.  
  
Steffi was the leader of her class's Local Service Learning Project in 2019. For this project, the class decided to partner with Singapore Association of Mental Health and interact with their beneficiaries to find out more about their needs. As AHTC, Steffi planned and facilitated an interactive session with the beneficiaries. She oversaw the budget, ensured effective administration, and carried out a smooth and meaningful programme. She led by example, stepping out of her comfort zone to converse with the beneficiaries and listen to their experiences of mental health challenges.  
  
_"Many of us were very academically driven, and being around others who shared a similar interest in studying really helped spur us on, despite the challenges of 2020. Our tutors were very willing to arrange consultation sessions with us after the HBL period. In addition, there are many past year papers in the library available for reference, and our tutors also made good use of online platforms such as Google Drive and SLS to help provide more materials and modules to facilitate our learning." _

**Ng Him Hean**  
  
Him Hean is an independent and inquisitive learner, always asking questions in class, and yet willing to listen to the opinions of others with an open mind. His pursuit of excellence is shown through his academic accolades, such as the Overall Top Performer of the JC1 cohort, and the Good Progress Award from the Ministry of Education in 2019.  
  
Him Hean's talent in the arts is most prominently seen in his ability to sustain critical analysis on an issue and negotiate complexities and ambiguities. Intrigued by what he learns in the classroom, he often conducts further research beyond what is taught for the A-Level curriculum and finds ways to apply his learning to issues in the real world. His qualification to read Economics at the H3 level is further proof of his aptitude in demonstrating original thinking and drawing intelligent connections across divergent concepts and ideas.  
  
Him Hean's involvement in College activities foregrounds the vibrant College life he experienced. He was a member of the college Modern Dance Society from 2019-2020 and served as an Orientation Group Leader (OGL) at the JC1 Orientation Programme in 2020. Being part of a Co-Curricular Activity that prizes performance results and perfection has trained Him Hean to be even more resilient, and to find satisfaction in pushing himself even harder than before. Such traits served him well as an OGL, when the team of OGLs was faced with the challenge of adapting to the changing demands of the programme due to new restrictions introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
_"I believe that what we should fear is complacency. When we become complacent, we demand more results for less work. One has to be brave and be willing to try different approaches to learning to find what works best for you."_

**Ong Wei, Dillon**  
  
Dillon was an Executive Committee member of his Co-Curricular Activity, Symphonic Band. A nurturing leader, he always strove to improve the band's technical skills, and lift their morale. He has also shown growth as a confident communicator able to convey complicated ideas succinctly to his bandsmen. Joining the Symphonic Band in CJC also led to Dillon actively pursuing his passion for music; he is teaching himself to write and rearrange music, and also runs a small channel on YouTube. He feels most fulfilled knowing that his music can empower people and move them out of hard places.  
  
In addition, Dillon was part of an academic trip organised by CJC, which included an Overseas Service Learning component. With his team, he actively sought to foster relationships between the visiting delegation and the Thai children from the orphanage through extending practical help, and by pulling off a carnival that was a brand new experience for many of them. Overall, Dillon served others with an open mind and was genuinely invested in the betterment of their lives.  
  
_"I think it is important to have good time management and some kind of structure because it is essential to finish your work on time and have sufficient rest. It's also very important to pay attention and maximise your time in class and tutorial lessons."_

**Jeremy Sim Wen Ze**  
  
Jeremy is a hardworking young man who constantly sought to improve in his studies. He was meticulous and detailed in his work, and prided himself in handing up neat and organised assignments. He managed his time well and was an independent learner. He was able to voice his opinions or raise doubts in class to facilitate his own learning and thus benefited others in the process. He likes solving problems and has an interest in how laws and theories are formulated in the Sciences.  
  
Jeremy was interested in sports and community service during his time in college. As an active member of Basketball Co-curricular Activity (CCA), he often led his peers in drills and encouraged them to try their best. He was a good team player and strove to train well to build up the strength of his team. Having a heart for the less fortunate, he joined his classmates in a Local Service Learning Project. For this Project, his class organised a befriending session with the elderly at Toa Payoh Care Corner for which he was in the sub-committee in charge of planning and purchasing refreshment for the seniors.

**Sim Jun Hong, Ryan**  
  
True to the CJC vision, Ryan pursued excellence in learning and living. Ryan is a self-directed learner who sought every opportunity to extend his learning beyond the classroom. With steely determination, he set clear academic goals amidst the disruption brought about by Home-Based Learning, and topped his cohort by achieving one of the highest rank points in CJC for his Continual Assessment 2 in 2020.  
  
Ryan also set a stellar example by being extremely disciplined with his training schedule for Swimming, his Co-Curricular Activity. He was also a club swimmer. He often swam at 5am before heading to school and travelled back to the swimming pool for training at the end of a school day. Consequently, he obtained the 3rd place for individual 100m Freestyle, 4th place for Freestyle and Medley Relay, as well as 5th place for the individual 200m Freestyle at the 2019 National School Games. He also received the Singapore School Sports Council Award in 2019 and the Edusave EAGLES award in 2020, which is given to students who demonstrate leadership qualities, service to community and schools, excellence in non-academic activities, and good conduct.  
  
"Mr Yang, my Chemistry tutor, was the most motivating teacher to me. He exemplified perseverance and pushing through \[the challenges\] by being able to patiently re-examine concepts with the class and for this I am grateful."

**Sung Yi Wen, Ella**  
  
A developer at heart, Ella takes pride in her improvement and growth, as well as that which she can bring about in others. It gives her great satisfaction knowing that she helped and brought good cheer to others. During classroom discussions, she was able to pick up relevant information from good articles for Economics, contributing to a dialogic classroom. Consequently, both Ella and her peers were able to take an inter-disciplinary approach to learning, as seen from their analysis of the confluence of economic and political considerations that impinge on everyday issues.  
  
Ella's sense of responsibility to the community and her awareness of cross cultural relations were manifested in her involvement in community service. As a member of her Co-Curricular Activity, Interact Club, she participated in numerous projects, including helping out at St Luke's ElderCare and hospitals. In doing so, she challenged herself to connect with the less fortunate and empathised with their plight. This was also the case for her class Local Service Learning Project with Bishan Home for the Intellectually Disabled where she interacted with the elderly, bringing entertainment and good cheer to many of them. Besides, her active participation in the CJC-organised Overseas Service Learning Programme 2019 in Vietnam also showed her consideration for the children in the village school; inasmuch as she shared her knowledge of English and of her culture, she also served with an open mind and learnt about their culture and experiences.  
  
_"Believing that God has a plan for me helped. Even if I did badly on that one test, it didn't mean that I wouldn't do well in the A-levels or in life. It's just one test. Grades don't define you."_

_"Resilience is crucial. It takes a lot of grit and hard work to do well, unless you are a genius. The other thing is to help others. If I had never helped someone else, I wouldn't have met that classmate who pulled me out of trying times. I felt like I was 'fighting' the A-Levels with support instead of fighting it alone." _

<img src="/images/classof202012.jpg" style="width:40%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

**Gerald Lim Da Xiang**  
  
Gerald enlivened classroom discussions with questions that showed his ability to think deeply about the topic at hand. He was quick to understand complex concepts, and could apply them to novel contexts with ease. Gerald was also consistently diligent, and his tutors commended him for being a role model to his peers in this regard.  
  
Gerald served as the Assistant Home Tutorial Councillor of his class, a role which he undertook with responsibility and enthusiasm. He showed grace under pressure while leading his class to plan a Local Service Learning Project in collaboration with the Assisi Hospice. His care for his community was also seen in his choice of Co-Curricular Activity, Interact Club. Demonstrating a strong sense of empathy and consideration for disadvantaged or neglected members of the community, Gerald and his peers served the less fortunate through various projects which saw them interacting with groups including children in need, and the elderly.  
  
"Find the joy in learning, and appreciate what we have. We should really slow down and take the time to connect the dots and just have fun in the process (of learning)."

**Eqsha P Nair**  
  
During her time in CJC, Eqsha grasped opportunities to challenge herself and broaden her thinking. She was part of the CJC Ignite Programme, a talent development programme aimed at developing critical thinkers and future-oriented leaders. Her good time management and study strategies contributed to her consistent performance at every examination. She won the Outstanding Academic Performance Award in the Mid-Year and Promotional Examinations in 2019.  
  
A critical thinker and articulate speaker, Eqsha also represented CJC at the Pre-U Seminar 2019, ASEAN Day Dinner 2019, and two Focus Group Discussions where she interacted with various ministers, ambassadors and directors from different ministries. Eqsha was also one of the seven students in her cohort to be awarded the English Language and Linguistics Scholarship by the Ministry of Education (MOE), a prestigious award reserved for the very best with a passion for and flair in the English Language. She thereby secured an internship with MOE's English Language and Literature Branch, where she displayed the ability to negotiate complexities and ambiguities in her work.  
  
Eqsha's strength in leadership was evident in her contributions to CJC and her Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), Choir. She was a well-respected Section Leader commended by her CCA teachers for her ability to take charge of her section while making sure every member was well taken care of. Her contributions to her CCA were cited as significant in Choir's achievement of a Certificate of Distinction in the 2019 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF) â the highest honour at the SYF. Eqsha was also hand-picked to be an Orientation Group Leader in 2020, where she rose to every challenge and stepped out of her comfort zone to make the best out of the situation for the incoming JC1s amidst the pandemic.

**Teow Eau Xin**  
  
Eau Xin's love for Chemistry and her dream of pursuing forensic science gave her the drive to work hard. She critically considered issues from different perspectives and this was evident from the relevant and insightful questions she posed. An independent learner, she managed her time well and was very clear about the progress she made, as well as areas for improvement. She would also actively troubleshoot problems and this was observed in her role as the Class Treasurer and Secretary in 2020; Eau Xin maintained a meticulous record of the class' expenses, and devised a system for the collection of funds that was easy for her classmates to follow.  
Eau Xin was also one of the National Day Parade Commanders in 2019, and she put in hours of practice to ensure that CJC's National Day Observance Ceremony ran smoothly. Her contributions to her community extended beyond CJC. In a class-initiated Local Service Learning Project, she volunteered at the Assisi Hospice at Mount Alvernia Hospital. She helped to care for the critically ill patients at the ward, and interacted with the elderly through games and activities. She served with an open mind, and was considerate and empathetic towards others in the community.  
  
_"Be self-reliant, and independent in study and revision -- this is useful for university because higher learning is reliant on self-directed learning."_

**Billy Muliorahardjo**  
  
Billy is a disciplined, motivated and consistent learner who puts in his best effort to achieve his goals. His critical thinking was evident in his assignments, and he submitted work that showed insight, lucidity and clear organization. With an analytical mind, Billy was able to understand concepts well and apply them widely. To stretch his abilities, the subject he offered at H3 level was Semiconductor Physics and Devices. He also cut his teeth at the Australian Mathematics Competition and Mathematical Olympiad, developing finely-honed problem-solving skills under pressure.  
  
Though Billy did not have more hours in a day, he still managed to juggle two Co-Curricular Activities. He was a dedicated member of the Volleyball team. Also, he served as the President of the Music Ministry, a key contributor to school events aligned with the College's Catholic ethos. His leadership abilities were also recognised as he was selected to be an Orientation Group Leader in 2020, and he was designated Overall-In-Charge for the Overseas Service Learning Programme in Vietnam in 2019. Billy' s track record for service shows that he is keenly aware of the responsibilities of being a member of the community, and to that end, participates actively in programmes that foster understanding between people from different socio-cultural and religious backgrounds.  
  
_"As a person who does not really like lectures, I liked being in the Ignite programme as the seminar-style teaching suited me better. CJC also gave me the opportunity to step up and help others, be it as a student leader in my second CCA, and serving others as part of the OSLP trip to Vietnam."_

**Tan Shean Yin, Jolene**  
  
Jolene takes pride in evaluating an issue from different perspectives, and has especial interest in Literature for its poetic exposure to critical insight on relevant issues. Jolene's love for reading is evident in the rigour of her writing. During her time in CJC, Jolene also had a number of stretch opportunities to engage with other inquisitive minds, sharpening her global awareness and cross-cultural skills. She attended two prestigious conferences: the "Building A Society of Opportunities Togetherâ Community Conversation and the 2019 S Rajaratnam Lecture. Jolene also actively participated in the 2019 STEP Sunburst Youth Camp with almost 150 other young people from across Asia. This week-long programme saw Jolene collaborate with delegates from 13 different countries to enrich her cultural understanding of Singapore and other parts of the world.  
  
Jolene finds great satisfaction in nurturing others and derives great joy from uplifting others. In her journey as the President of the Student Council (2019-2020), she has made tremendous effort to be worthy of her appointment. She has been an exemplary role model for seeking self-improvement, and in recognising her peers' strengths and talents, edified them to grow into their roles and maximise their potential. Jolene's involvement in community service provides further evidence of her consideration for others, as she goes beyond her assigned duties to give with open hands. After volunteering with her class at the Care Corner Student Care Centre (Admiralty) in 2019, she volunteered weekly with TOUCH Young Arrows to provide academic coaching and plan value-driven activities for primary school children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  
  
_"I drew confidence and energy from all the school activities and all the people I've had the privilege to be around. They gave me the motivation and purpose to continue to keep striving. Trust yourself, and trust in the goodness of everyone you work with; see the purpose in what you do, and love what you do."_
