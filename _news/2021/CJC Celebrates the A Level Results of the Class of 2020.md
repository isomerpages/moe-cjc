Though 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges brought about by Covid-19, the Class of 2020 did themselves and the College proud and achieved excellence at the 2020 GCE A-Level examinations. CJC continued to achieve commendable distinctions in different A-Level subjects, maintaining value-adding performance of our students. The College is proud to have many CJCians realising their aspirations and qualifying for institutes of higher learning both locally and overseas.  
  
Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, congratulated the Class of 2020 on their good results. She said, "your cohort had to contend with unforeseen key challenges such as full home-based learning, but you demonstrated determination, resilience, teamwork and class spirit to overcome these challenge and achieve commendable results. We salute you for remaining steadfast in the midst of challenges and for never losing sight of your goals and aspirations". Besides achieving good academic results, she noted that many students were able to juggle their academic, CCA, leadership and community service commitments as well as provide care and support for their classmates during challenging times. This reflected their all-round leadership development. She urged the Class of 2020 to continue learning, leading and serving as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.  
  
Mrs Poon Wai Chin, Vice-Principal/Academic added, "our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2020 on your good results. We know that the human spirit is always stronger and more resilient than we think, and your results have proven that. The relentless desire to excel and reach out drives us to never settle for second best, but to keep going, looking out for each other as we do so. I wish you the very best in life as you continue to find ways to serve and lead with heart and passion."  
  
The College extends its heartfelt appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee and the alumni for the support, guidance and encouragement of the students throughout their educational journey in CJC. May God continue to bless our Class of 2020 with wisdom and grace as they take flight as Thinkers and Leaders and make a positive impact on society. The College celebrates the outstanding achievements of the following CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart.
