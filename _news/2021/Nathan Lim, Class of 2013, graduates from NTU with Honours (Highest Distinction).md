Behind almost every success story is a testimony of sacrifice, setback and a radical change of direction. Catholic Junior College (CJC) alumnus, Nathan Lim (Class of 2013), is no stranger to that. He is a true example of a CJCian who realised his aspirations through perseverance, hard work and tenacity. Nathan graduated with a Bachelor’s degree from Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) School of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), and received Honours (Highest Distinction) (formerly First Class Honours) in the NTU-MSE Convocation for the Class of 2020.

In CJC, Nathan served as the Vice-President of Student Activities in the 38th Student Council. Nathan learnt to juggle his duties as a student councillor with the academic rigour of the GCE A-Level curriculum. Having no prior leadership experience, Nathan found that he needed to quickly adapt to the demands of student leadership. With the support of his fellow student councillors and teachers, Nathan played a very active role in the planning of numerous major college events. These experiences shaped his values and outlook in life.

After graduating from CJC, Nathan chose to pursue his passion in renewable energy, more specifically solar energy, and applied to the School of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at NTU. University life went well for him as he worked conscientiously in his chosen discipline.  However, it was not without its challenges. Nathan faced a setback when his application for the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) was rejected. Yet, he did not let his disappointment drag him down as he held on to his determination and belief that such an outlook would stop him from moving towards his goals. On his third attempt, he managed to secure the scholarship and was awarded the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) Mid-Term Scholarship REC Solar/SgIS in August 2019.

Nathan shared that receiving his pre-university education in CJC prepared him immensely for life through the various opportunities and experiences that he received, both academic and co-curricular. He is grateful for the strong support system provided by his subject tutors and Council teachers. Nathan extends his encouragement to CJCians to continue working hard towards their goals – “Hindsight is 20/20, so make the time you have in CJ to be the most memorable one you’ll ever have.”
