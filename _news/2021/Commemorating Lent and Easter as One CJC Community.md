### **Commemorating Lent and Easter as One CJC Community**
Despite the challenges this year, the Catholic Junior College (CJC) community burned ever bright, commemorating the holy seasons of Lent and Easter in a myriad of ways. This was done through the Lenten and Easter Project spearheaded by the Catholic Activities Wing of the 46th Student Council. The theme this year was ‘Ashes to Glory’. Ashes remind us that we are dust and to dust we will return, symbolic of our dependence on God and our need to trust in him. Glory represents the honour we give to God as he has died for our sins to save us, as well as His glorious resurrection on Easter. This theme was intended to guide the college into a deeper reflection on Jesus’s suffering, death, and resurrection - the great mystery of faith that demonstrates God’s love for humanity.
