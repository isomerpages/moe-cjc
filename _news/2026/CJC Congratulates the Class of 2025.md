<p>(CJCians celebrating the journey undertaken together as a cohort)</p>
<p>Catholic Junior College (CJC) gives thanks to God for our students’ strong
showing at the 2025 GCE A-Level examinations and we congratulate them for
the good distinction rates across different subjects. Our CJCians’ academic
achievements reflect the grit and resolve in pursuit of their goals, and
they are well placed to qualify for reputable local and overseas institutes
of higher learning and being one step closer to their dreams.</p>
<p>Mrs Woo Soo Min, Principal of CJC, congratulates the Class of 2025 and
said, “I am very proud of the CJCians from the Class of 2025. As the 50th
batch of CJCians, they led their juniors in organising the CJ50 celebrations,
all college events and CCAs, bringing about a very positive schooling experience
to their peers, and raising the college spirit to a new high.&nbsp; At
the same time, they have given the best of themselves in embracing learning
and the results that they reaped bear testimony to their efforts.&nbsp;
I am confident that CJCIans will continue to illuminate the way for others
as they scale new heights.”</p>
<p>Celebrating the achievements of the Class of 2025, Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal
(Student Development), said, “the future presents immense possibilities
for you. I encourage you to cherish all the experiences that you have had,
to remain curious, and be passionate in all your endeavours. Continue to
create meaningful connections with those whom you meet, especially with
fellow CJCians of our CJ family. I am confident that you will continue
to shine wherever you are. Not only have you done well, your contributions
to the legacy of the CJC community are immeasurable.”</p>
<p>The college would like to thank our dedicated teachers, administrative
staff, parents, the School Management Committee (SMC) and alumni for supporting
the Class of 2025 throughout their A-Level journey. We, as a CJ family,
have always valued holistic development, building generations of thinkers
and leaders in the last 50 years and more untold.</p>
