### **Celebrating the launch of the Sister Deirdre O’Loan Centre for Creativity, 24 May 2022**
The CJC Sister Deirdre O’Loan Centre for Creativity was launched on 24 May 2022 by Mr Ong Kong Hong, Zonal Director of Schools (South). The launch was the culmination of years of meticulous planning and hard work by the CJC team involved in the School of the Future (SOTF) project initiated by the Ministry of Education (MOE).

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal, CJC, said that the Sister Deirdre O’Loan Centre for Creativity’s innovative “Conceptualise”, “Create” and “Connect” learning spaces are based on the College’s belief that students can develop into effective thinkers and leaders if they have access to resources and opportunities that optimise engaged learning.

<b><u>Conceptualise Space</b></u><br>
The Conceptualise Space is a technology-enabled space with modular seating. In this space, teachers can leverage on the affordances of technology to meaningfully enhance teaching and learning. The flexible configuration of the space creates endless opportunities for innovative pedagogy.

<b><u>Create Space</b></u><br>
The Create Space is a creative space where students can brainstorm and use 3D printers and laser cutters to create their own prototypes of ideas. This is useful for the College’s emphasis on STEM workshops and programmes.

<b><u>Connect Space</b></u><br>
The Connect Space is an exhibition and event space where students can engage with and showcase their ideas to their peers; and engage members of the wider community including Voluntary Welfare Organisations to develop academic, student development or service learning projects.

Together, these three innovative learning spaces provide students and teachers with a seamless and flexible learning environment that will bring engaged learning to greater heights in the College. We also hope that this innovative project can be scaled up to be implemented in more schools, as part of MOE’s School of the Future (SOTF) project.
