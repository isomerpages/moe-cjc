### **Alumni Sports Fiesta and CJCares Fundraising Campaign, 23 July 2022**
After a two-year hiatus, our alumni were in the highest of spirits for this year’s Alumni Sports Fiesta. A glorious Saturday morning saw teams from a range of graduating batches coming together and battling it out in five different sporting events – Captain’s Ball, Football, Frisbee, Rugby and Tennis. Students from our CJC sports CCAs also gathered to join in the fun! (Watch the video highlights&nbsp;[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPdqsrPYB0).)

It was wonderful to finally be able to gather our CJC family together again. Old friends were reunited, new friends were made and a myriad of CJC memories came alive once more.

A big thank you to our alumni also for supporting our CJCares fundraising efforts, going towards the CJC needy student fund. Till next time!
