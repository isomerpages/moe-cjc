### **Alumni Sports Fiesta and CJCares Fundraising Campaign, 23 July 2022**
After a two-year hiatus, our alumni were in the highest of spirits for this year’s Alumni Sports Fiesta. A glorious Saturday morning saw teams from a range of graduating batches coming together and battling it out in five different sporting events – Captain’s Ball, Football, Frisbee, Rugby and Tennis. Students from our CJC sports CCAs also gathered to join in the fun! (Watch the video highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPdqsrPYB0).)
