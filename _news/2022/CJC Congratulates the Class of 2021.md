The Class of 2021 achieved commendable results at the 2021 GCE A-Level examinations and did themselves and the College proud. Catholic Junior College (CJC) maintained its strong value-added performance with good distinction rates across the different A-Level subjects. The school is delighted to have many CJCians realise their aspirations and qualify for local and overseas institutes of higher learning.  

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, congratulated the Class of 2021 on their outstanding results. She said, “we celebrate the determination, effort and good results of the Class of 2021. Your cohort took the many disruptions of COVID-19 in your stride, rose above challenges and worked together as one CJ Family to achieve this important academic milestone in your lives. We affirm your growth mindset in not giving up in the face of trying circumstances, and we are heartened by the steely determination you demonstrated.” Mrs Lim cherishes the culture of care among CJCians as they supported each other while fulfilling their academic, co-curricular activity (CCA), leadership and community service commitments. This is a testament to the strength of the holistic student development programmes in CJC, which aim to develop generations of Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.

Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal/Student Development added, “our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2021 on your good results. The road ahead has many opportunities and I encourage all of you to hold fast to your dreams and aspirations, to remain hopeful always and to persevere in the face of adversity. May you keep the CJC flame alive by maintaining close ties with the college and CJC family. You are always welcome to return to the school to guide your juniors as they navigate their way through the journey you have successfully completed.”

The College extends its deepest appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee (SMC) and the alumni for the support, guidance and encouragement they have given the students throughout their time in CJC. May God continue to bless our Class of 2021 with grace and wisdom as they take flight as thinkers and leaders who will make a positive impact on society.

The College celebrates the outstanding achievements of the following CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart.
