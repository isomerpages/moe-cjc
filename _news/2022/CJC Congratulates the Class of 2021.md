<iframe allowfullscreen="true" height="569" width="960" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRuiGNWeTSkEHbA_Xn4FiNiFJtupMF63Imi2JCVISQJjPtjDKHfNcUPG7pIPtFa4WA5Tc4J342l7BW7/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe>

The Class of 2021 achieved commendable results at the 2021 GCE A-Level examinations and did themselves and the College proud. Catholic Junior College (CJC) maintained its strong value-added performance with good distinction rates across the different A-Level subjects. The school is delighted to have many CJCians realise their aspirations and qualify for local and overseas institutes of higher learning.  

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal of CJC, congratulated the Class of 2021 on their outstanding results. She said, “we celebrate the determination, effort and good results of the Class of 2021. Your cohort took the many disruptions of COVID-19 in your stride, rose above challenges and worked together as one CJ Family to achieve this important academic milestone in your lives. We affirm your growth mindset in not giving up in the face of trying circumstances, and we are heartened by the steely determination you demonstrated.” Mrs Lim cherishes the culture of care among CJCians as they supported each other while fulfilling their academic, co-curricular activity (CCA), leadership and community service commitments. This is a testament to the strength of the holistic student development programmes in CJC, which aim to develop generations of Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart.

Mr Tan Jek Suan, Vice-Principal/Student Development added, “our heartiest congratulations to the Class of 2021 on your good results. The road ahead has many opportunities and I encourage all of you to hold fast to your dreams and aspirations, to remain hopeful always and to persevere in the face of adversity. May you keep the CJC flame alive by maintaining close ties with the college and CJC family. You are always welcome to return to the school to guide your juniors as they navigate their way through the journey you have successfully completed.”

The College extends its deepest appreciation to all teachers, administrative staff, parents, the School Management Committee (SMC) and the alumni for the support, guidance and encouragement they have given the students throughout their time in CJC. May God continue to bless our Class of 2021 with grace and wisdom as they take flight as thinkers and leaders who will make a positive impact on society.

The College celebrates the outstanding achievements of the following CJCians who exemplify the traits of a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart.

**Sara Ong Zi Ning**<br>
Sara is a diligent and conscientious learner who takes ownership of her learning. She sets high standards for herself and works strategically to achieve them. An analytical thinker, she demonstrates an ability to grasp complex concepts, and to apply them appropriately in different contexts. She attained various academic accolades including the award for Outstanding Overall Performance when she was a J1 student.

Sara also took the initiative to seize opportunities for broadening her mind. She signed up for the Lee Kong Chian Anatomy Challenge and the Singapore Chemistry Olympiad which provided her with rich learning experiences. She also demonstrated exemplary work ethic as a member of the CJC Fencing Team. Passionate and self-motivated, she went above the call of duty to devote extra time and effort to hone her fencing skills.

_“2T19 was definitely the best class I have been in; we joke around to keep each other entertained and when it was time to be serious, we worked hard together so that we did not feel alone in this difficult journey. Their positive energy was what kept me going in CJ._

_Whenever you feel like giving up, always look back to why you started in the first place.  Even if you do not have a \[specific\] reason, remember to try your best in everything that you do. If you ever feel lost, know that there is so much ahead of you and life extends far beyond the A-Levels.”_

**Tan Jia Ying Judith**<br>
Having an admirable capacity for critical thinking, Judith was able to draw thoughtful connections across different concepts and subject disciplines when she was a student. Her assignments demonstrated depth of insight as well as maturity of thought. Furthermore, she worked diligently to master her various academic subjects by completing additional assignments for her subject tutors. Although Judith distinguished herself academically, she remained humble, and kept motivating herself to strive for improvement. As a selfless individual, Judith was always ready to lend a helping hand to her peers whenever they encountered academic-related challenges. Due to her strength of character and empathy for others, Judith was awarded the Edusave Character Award in 2020.

Judith was also an exemplary student leader who was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the college's Student Council. A meticulous planner, Judith ensured the smooth facilitation of various school events. She was firm yet kind in her dealings with her peers as one of her personal beliefs is that leaders are supposed to edify people. She held herself to high standards as she wanted to inspire her peers through her work ethic. One of the most memorable leadership experiences that Judith was involved in was an Academic Immersion Programme with Tranh Phu High School in Vietnam which was conducted on Zoom. Together with her student leader counterparts in Vietnam, they planned ways to make the online event as memorable as it could be. Through this, Judith displayed the ability to work with people from diverse cultures and backgrounds. As a woman of faith, Judith also oversaw the Catholic Activities Wing. She helped to plan various Catholic events in the college such as the Lenten Evening where she led her peers through a time of spiritual reflection.

_“In CJ, I found a community in my Council family that I will bring with me wherever life may take me. They showed me what it is like to belong to a place, to a home._

_I strive everyday to do whatever I do \[as a leader\] from the bottom of my heart so that others may hopefully be inspired by the passion, rather than the part of me that simply ‘leads’.”_

<img src="/images/classof20213.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

**Marina Kaye Lim**<br>
A self-possessed, eloquent and expressive individual, Marina was a natural fit for her Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), the Drama Society. She not only developed her skills as an actor, but also branched out into scriptwriting. She was eventually chosen to be the Vice-President of the Drama Society due to her ability to inspire her peers. In light of the safety measures that had to be adhered to because of the ongoing pandemic, Marina and her peers devised performances that took on innovative formats—a testament to their resourcefulness and creativity.

Marina set herself apart as a capable writer with strong and nuanced views. Beyond the classroom, Marina seized different opportunities for self-development. Her involvement in the SG100 Young Leaders Programme 2020 afforded her the opportunity to interact with young people from diverse backgrounds and imbibe fresh perspectives. Furthermore, her keen interest in current affairs prompted her to take part in a forum on gender equality with students from Waseda Shibuya Senior High School, and a dialogue on education policy.

_“I am very grateful to CJC not just for all the challenges I faced, I was also offered many opportunities such as emceeing and being a student leader. As an Ignite student, I participated in many forums and dialogues. This abundance of opportunities made me so grateful for CJ._

_Another thing I am grateful for is the environment I was placed in. My class and my CCA were very wholesome and supportive, and their acts of encouragement kept me going. This was the best school I could have been placed in.”_

**Wan Wai Loong, Joshua**<br>
Joshua was disciplined in keeping up with the rigorous demands of the A-level curriculum. He consistently maintained outstanding grades during his time in CJC. His academic accolades include the Subject Prize Award for H2 History in 2020, as well as the Central Singapore Community Development Council and Moulmein-Cairnhill Citizen's Consultative Education Merit Award. Joshua demonstrated a rare capacity for independent learning:  He was able to identify his own learning gaps, and took the initiative to address them. Confident and articulate, he participated actively during tutorials by contributing insightful responses much to the delight of his tutors and peers. Joshua put his effective communication skills to good use when he performed the role of a student moderator during a visit to the school by Ms Lai Wei-Lin, the former 2nd Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Education. He was also a student ambassador for the College's Open House Virtual College Tour where he engaged visitors who were interested in finding out more about the school.

Besides excelling in his academic endeavours, Joshua was also an outstanding leader. Joshua fulfilled his responsibilities as the Vice-President of the Nexus Society competently. He was tasked to plan an enriching CCA program for his peers which required foresight and resourcefulness on his part. Furthermore, he was in charge of the inaugural Bizweek where the Nexus Society ran a week-long programme to educate their peers on financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Under Joshua’s capable leadership, the programme turned out to be a great success. In recognition of his outstanding leadership and co-curricular achievements, Joshua received the prestigious CJC Flame Scholarship in 2020 and 2021. 

_“In CJ, the focus is a lot on holistic development which I found to be a great part of my journey as a student. CJ focuses a lot on an all-round academic development through the various stretch programmes. CJ really helped me to focus on myself and character-building through the Student Development lessons and local service learning programmes, while giving me ample training and teaching to be able to do well in the As.”_

<img src="/images/classof20215.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

**Loh Ming Cheng**<br>
Loh Ming Cheng is an inquisitive learner who enjoys acquiring new knowledge. Self-motivated and disciplined, he consistently put in effort to excel in his studies. In recognition of his stellar academic performance, Ming Cheng was conferred the Edusave Certificate of Academic Achievement in 2020, and placed on the Principal's Honour Roll for the 2020 Promotional Examinations.

As a dedicated member of the college Track and Field team, Ming Cheng invested time and effort to bond with his peers, and to ensure that they maintained a rigorous training regimen. He motivated his teammates throughout the grueling training sessions, and ensured that no one was left behind. Ming Cheng was also able to hone his leadership skills as the Class Treasurer of his home class.

In addition, Ming Cheng was actively involved in college life, participating in a variety of programmes such as the Nara High School Exchange Programme and several economics seminars organised by local universities. Ming Cheng was also deeply invested in giving back to the community, as seen in his active participation in a class-initiated local service learning project for Morning Star Community Services. Throughout the course of the project, he gained eye-opening insights into the plight of underprivileged children in Singapore and their lived realities.

_“I am fortunate because my tutors were simply amazing and they put in a lot of effort so I could understand what they were teaching easily. I also feel that CJC’s culture helped me feel less overwhelmed and kept me afloat."_

<img src="/images/classof20216.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-left:25px;" align = "right">

**Rayan Wong**<br>
Rayan is a bright and inquisitive learner. To broaden his horizons and enrich his content mastery of his academic subjects, Rayan represented the college at several international science challenges and olympiads. He excelled academically during his time in CJC where he was consistently placed on the Principal's Honor Roll for major college examinations.

Rayan's also demonstrated an abiding commitment to excellence as a member of the college's Ten-Pin Bowling team. He learned to juggle a demanding training schedule with his academic commitments, and was deeply committed to developing as a bowler. He also took it upon himself to guide his juniors by offering them invaluable advice on bowling.

To develop himself holistically, Rayan immersed himself in various school programmes. He was appointed the Human Resource Manager of an intra-college peer-tutoring initiative which required him to find suitable learning resources to help his peers who were in need of academic assistance. Additionally, he participated in overseas academic immersion programmes with Nara Senior High School in Japan, as well as Tran Phu High School in Vietnam where he learnt more about the richness of the Vietnamese and Japanese cultures.

_“You will face setbacks in your JC journey and you may face some really tough times, but the end is near, so you just have to push through, that’s life. Sometimes you just do what you have to do no matter what.”_

<img src="/images/classof20217.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

**Lim Geok Siao, Evan**<br>
Evan impressed his tutors with his strong work ethic and unflagging desire to learn beyond the prescribed curriculum. To deepen his mastery of physics, Evan chose to study the subject at the H3 level. A generous and warm-hearted individual, Evan was also eager to share his knowledge with his peers. Never one to shy away from a challenge, Evan took part in many competitions like the Australian Mathematics Competition 2020 where he was awarded a Distinction award, and the International Mathematical Modelling Challenge 2021 where he received a Merit award.

Evan chose Cross Country and Ultimate Frisbee as his two co-curricular activities (CCA). A servant leader at heart, Evan took on an executive committee role to oversee the welfare of his peers in the Cross Country CCA. Evan also served as the Secretary and Treasurer of his class. 

_“One key quality for me might be ‘tenacity’. The motivation for me is finding anything around me and turning it into a push or desire to do more, and to do better. I think I also had a mindset which reminded me that “it’s never enough”. It may sound pressurising, but it is a good kind of stress which pushes me to do better and achieve my career in the future.”_

<img src="/images/classof20218.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-left:25px;" align = "right">

**Koh Kai Jun, Kevin**<br>
Kevin performed consistently well in school examinations. He was on the Principal's Honour Roll for the JC1 Promotional Examinations, and he was also one of the top performers for the JC2 Mid-Year and Preliminary Examinations.

As a dedicated member of the Badminton co-curricular activity (CCA), Kevin trained determinedly to prepare for the National School Games. Despite the grueling training schedule, he remained level-headed and committed to academic excellence. He planned his time wisely to ensure that he did not fall behind in his studies. He also served as a mentor to his juniors in the CCA who look up to him as a role model.

Kevin is also a civic-minded individual who finds meaning in helping others. His class partnered with Family Central by Fei Yue in 2020 to create a leisure activity in the form of a customised Monopoly game for the elderly. Drawing on his knowledge of the plight of the elderly, Kevin came up with the idea of creating a board game for the elderly to alleviate their loneliness.

_“‘Hard work beats talent when talent does not work hard’. If you truly want to do well for the As you have to prioritize your goals and make sacrifices.”_

<img src="/images/classof20219.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

**Benjamin Lim Kay Loke**<br>
Benjamin is an intelligent student who is enthusiastic about learning. He absorbs ideas quickly and shows a disposition for lateral thinking. As a student, he was intrinsically motivated to acquire knowledge outside the prescribed syllabus, and this led him to represent CJC at the 2020 Singapore Biology Olympiad. Some of his notable academic achievements include the Outstanding Academic Performance award for the 2020 JC1 Promotional Examinations and the 2021 JC2 Mid-Year Examinations.

Extroverted and sociable, Benjamin is adept at collaborating with others. A proficient dancer, Benjamin joined Modern Dance as his Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in CJC. His ability to inspire others served him well during his time in Modern Dance. During physically demanding trainings, he made it a point to encourage his peers to persevere. He even went the extra mile to coach his peers whenever they struggled with the choreography for various dance routines. His passion for dance shone through a self-choreographed piece performed during the 2020 Teachers' Day celebration. He was also part of the crew of Joseph House dancers who led the house in an upbeat Zumba-inspired workout during the Cross Factor Games in 2021. Benjamin has done the school proud by working with his fellow CCA members to clinch the Distinction award at the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP). Benjamin was also appointed Assistant Home Tutorial Councillor (AHTC) of his class from 2020 to 2021. He was diligent in assisting his Home Tutor, and also in supporting his classmates throughout the preparation process for their service learning project.

_“As the Assistant Home Tutorial Councillor of my class, I had the opportunity to lead my class in the local service learning planning while juggling my schoolwork. That taught me the importance of leadership and time management.”_

<img src="/images/classof202110.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-left:25px;" align = "right">

**Ng Xing Yi, Amanda**<br>
Amanda was an academically capable student during her time in CJC. Her relentless pursuit of academic excellence paid off when she was awarded the Outstanding Academic Performance for the 2020 JC1 Promotional Examinations as well as the 2021 JC2 Mid-Year Examinations.

Amanda was part of the Netball co-curricular activity (CCA) in CJC. Despite being new to netball, Amanda trained diligently with a can-do attitude, and eventually caught up with the rest of her more experienced peers. An outward-looking individual, Amanda always looked out for her peers during training, and was always on hand to provide emotional support whenever the occasion called for it. She also honed her communication skills during her time in the Netball CCA as she had to train and mentor her juniors. Amanda was also a part of her class's Local Service Learning Project (LSLP) with Care Corner, an after-school organisation for disadvantaged children. She participated whole-heartedly in the project which saw Amanda and her classmates facilitating games for a group of children. She found the experience meaningful as she brought joy to the beneficiaries. 

_“Personally, I wanted to have grades that I know I will be proud of and have no regrets in the future so that ‘future’ me will thank me for the hard work that I put myself through these two years._

_I cannot wait to grow as a person and be impactful to others as they have been to me.”_

**Chloe Frances Chang Xing En**<br>
A perceptive and vocal individual, Chloe is unafraid to speak her mind. During class discussions, Chloe offered astute insights that reflected the depth of her content mastery. Being a confident speaker, Chloe was selected to represent the college at local conferences and dialogues. Keen to stretch herself intellectually and solve scientific problems in real-life contexts, Chloe joined the school’s Ignite Programme. She also participated in the Singapore Chemistry Olympiad as well as the Computational and Algorithmic Thinking Competition. Chloe was more than able to keep up with the demands of her academic subjects; she was consistently ranked among the top students in her cohort for school examinations.

Having a strong interest in the sciences, Chloe joined the Environmental Science Society. As part of the Orientation planning committee for the Co-Curricular Activity, Chloe came up with creative ways to engage the new members and kindle their interest in environmental issues. Chloe also participated in the Science Centre COVID-19 Programme where she gained a broad and nuanced understanding of the different needs of people in Singapore who have been affected by the pandemic.

_“How much you learn in a lesson depends on how much effort or participation you put in. If you do not ask any questions, you will not learn as much.”_

<img src="/images/classof202112.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-left:25px;" align = "right">

**Wee Kiat Ming, Nicholas**<br>
A socially confident and approachable individual, Nicholas was well-liked by his peers and tutors. Having an analytical mind, Nicholas is able to grasp and apply concepts intelligently. He is also a well-read individual who possesses a vast knowledge of current affairs. Articulate on paper as well as in person, Nicholas demonstrates a strong grasp of the English language. Being a well-rounded individual, Nicholas also demonstrates an aptitude for mathematics and science. He was named valedictorian of the Science faculty and delivered a thoughtful speech at the graduation ceremony. He also attained the A\*STAR Science Award (Junior College) in 2020, and represented the school at various national and international competitions such as the Mathematics and Chemistry Olympiads, the Computation and Algorithmic Thinking (CAT) Competition, and the International Mathematical Modelling Challenge 2021.

As an executive member of the CJC Environmental Science Society, he planned and facilitated enriching learning experiences for his fellow members. His contributions to the community are also commendable. In 2020, his class decided to work with the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) in 2020 to raise awareness of mental well-being amongst youths in Singapore. Nicholas willingly gave his time and commitment to ensure that the project was a success.

_“I felt that as a class, we respected each other a lot. We understood that we liked our atmosphere for studying - and we really bonded, not in the traditional sense, but helping each other in our learning and always respecting each other’s needs.”_

<img src="/images/classof202113.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

**Roxanne Ho Xin Yi**<br>
Roxanne was a driven and intellectually curious student who often took the initiative to seek help from her tutors to deepen her learning. Having a strong work ethic, Roxanne produced excellent written assignments. An independent learner, Roxanne consistently tracked her own academic progress, set clear targets for herself, and worked diligently to achieve them. She was also warm and personable in her interactions with her peers who confided in her whenever they faced personal challenges.

Responsible and committed in all her undertakings, Roxanne was chosen to serve as the Captain of the college’s Badminton co-curricular activity (CCA)—a role which she performed admirably. Beyond the day-to-day administrative tasks that she had to fulfil, Roxanne leveraged on her expertise in badminton to help her peers in the CCA sharpen their skills. Roxanne also went the extra mile to foster camaraderie amongst her fellow CCA members.

_“With home-based learning, I actually got closer to my classmates because we would often help each other out. We would send text messages to each other about anything we were unclear about because unlike being physically in class, we could not just talk to each other face to face. I think messaging each other or calling each other made us closer over time.”_

<img src="/images/classof202114.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-left:25px;" align = "right">

**Madeleine Chau Wen Hui**<br>
Madeleine is a focused individual who works towards achieving her personal goals with steely determination. The dedication with which she pursues self-improvement is remarkable in a pre-university student. Her style of learning is characterised by independence and intentionality. Unafraid of hard work and change, Madeleine adapted well to new modes of learning throughout her two years in CJC. This was seen in her involvement in CJC’s inaugural _Litera_, an online literary mixed-media festival. She engaged both creatively and critically with her Literature A-Level texts by partnering with her peers to write, direct, and star in a reality show episode featuring the female characters of her A-Level texts.

She excelled in the area of project management during her time in Genesis, her second Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). She grew in organisational thinking and planning as one of the founding members and Vice-President of Genesis, working tirelessly to refine, systematise, and document her processes for the sake of succeeding cohorts. Above all, her sacrifices did not embitter her and she served with open hands in both Genesis and her other CCA, Choir. Her passion for helping others also made her a natural fit for the position of Pastoral Care Councillor of her class. In the spirit of generosity, Madeleine shared meticulous notes and welfare packs with her classmates. Madeleine’s strong sense of mission is matched by her competence and high standards of excellence.

_“Despite the challenging times when we moved to online learning, we still had a very robust curriculum that included additional resources we were given. Such as TedTalks and additional readings that were very interesting. I feel that having such a strong foundation gives me motivation and makes me want to build onto that strong foundation that I have been so blessed to have. Building on that, I think I also focused a lot on liking my subjects and challenging myself to make rest a priority too._

_I am very passionate about CJC and I think that without the kind of support that they gave me and without the kind of openness they allowed me to feel vulnerable in, I would not have been able to come so far. Emotional support from your teachers and friends is very valuable, especially through the pandemic when you cannot really meet face to face. Knowing that people are there for you really helped me pull through.”_

<img src="/images/classof202115.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

**Adam Eli Stewart**<br>
Throughout his journey as a CJC student, Eli learnt to think independently, and to justify his views persuasively. He is not only an articulate orator who is able to hold forth on various issues, but is also a thoughtful listener. His skills as an orator were recognised when he was given the Outstanding Delegate award at CJC’s own iteration of the Model United Nations. Eli actively pursues knowledge in his diverse areas of interest which include public policy, film and literature. He independently sought out opportunities to learn by attending courses conducted by the National University of Singapore, and signing up for a webinar series facilitated by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. To fuel his interest in the arts, Eli volunteered at the Singapore International Film Festival, and the Asian Film Archive where he helped to catalogue old films. His love for film is a natural outgrowth of his passion for literature which was nurtured during his time in CJC. 

Eli’s leadership potential was recognised by his peers and tutors; hence, he was appointed the President of the Student Council. Eli led a group of committed student leaders who helped to create a vibrant and close-knit school community in CJC. He was awarded the CJC Flame Scholarship for two consecutive years because of his capable leadership and commendable academic results.

_“Any CJCian who can find a group of friends whom they can turn to, and put in the effort to understand what they are learning can do well for the A-Levels, but I believe that it is about finding a greater purpose that will make everything much easier.”_

<img src="/images/classof202116.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-left:25px;" align = "right">

**Fang Heidi-Eeshin**<br>
Heidi stands out for her commitment to self-improvement. This has seen her challenge herself to maximise her time in CJC. She was selected for the Ignite talent development programme which honed her ability to think deeply about diverse issues in a seminar-style setting. She actively involved herself in Cross-Country, her Co-Curricular Activity, training three times a week without fail—and when pandemic-induced disruptions put a stop to her training, she managed her own fitness.

In recognition of her leadership potential, Heidi was appointed the Patrick House Captain which required her to manage all the class representatives known as Sports Leaders. This afforded her opportunities to work in a team to spearhead the planning and execution of College-wide sporting activities and events. When plans were cancelled, modified, or moved to different platforms as a result of the pandemic, Heidi and her peers were able to circumvent the limitations that they had to grapple with. What is most commendable is how Heidi grew in her readiness to challenge herself in different ways. She has grown into a more self-assured and outspoken young person who is able to lead and serve.

_“It is really about prioritising and doing the right things at the right time. Most importantly, get a lot of sleep because if you do not, you will not be able to process the information as well.”_

**Ryan Ng**<br>
A warm-hearted individual, Ryan gets along well with his peers who hold him in high regard. He is also an independent and conscientious learner who demonstrates a strong aptitude for his favourite subject, mathematics. He was deeply invested in his learning during his time in CJC, and held himself to high standards. Self-disciplined and grounded, Ryan struck an effective balance between his academic and CCA commitments.

As a member of the Symphonic Band, Ryan provided his peers with emotional support to build team spirit and camaraderie. He played a significant role in helping the Symphonic Band attain a Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP). Being a socially conscious individual, Ryan was determined to carry out his class-initiated Service Learning Project (SLP) in collaboration with Filos Community Services (Filos) to the best of his ability. Ryan was tasked to create enriching resources to educate children and youth on cyberbullying and online scams. Despite the challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 situation, Ryan and his classmates successfully carried out their programme via video conferencing.
