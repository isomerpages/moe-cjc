On 12 July, Catholic Junior College (CJC) held its first combined Student Leaders Appreciation and Installation Ceremony since the streamlining of COVID-19 national Safe Management Measures (SMM) this year. It was a widely-anticipated event since the college community could finally celebrate this momentous occasion in a common physical space to formally welcome the newly-appointed student leaders from the JC1 cohort, and to affirm the contributions of the outgoing JC2 student leaders.

The ceremony began with a homily by the College Chaplain, Father Justin Yip, to thank God for his guidance throughout our students’ leadership and academic journey. Mrs Phyllis Lim, the Principal, then delivered the opening address where she thanked the JC2 student leaders for their dedicated service. She also shared that leadership is fundamentally reliant on teamwork and urged the JC1 leaders to work closely with the student body.

Next, the guest-of-honour, Ms Amanda Thian, Class of 2010, was invited onstage. Ms Thian is a CJC alumna and a former member of the 35th Student Council. As a successful consulting manager, Ms Thian is no stranger to being a leader, and she generously shared tips on how to lead others effectively. She emphasised the importance of exercising truth and love — the core values of CJC, in their own leadership journeys. She urged CJCians to fall in love with what they do as leaders with a heart for passion can bring them to great heights. Her speech concluded with a poignant message: “We rise by lifting others.”

In the appreciation ceremony that followed, JC2 student leaders from various CCAs, Houses and the 47th Student Council received certificates of appreciation from the school leaders. The passing of the flame from the 47th Student Council President, Valsalan Nivish (2T09) to the 48th Student Council President, Aqil Aufa Bin Muhammad Taufiq (1T18) was certainly one of the highlights of the ceremony, signifying the handover of leadership to the next generation of student leaders. In his speech, Aqil expressed his appreciation to the college for putting their trust in him, and shared his strong belief in the leadership potential of all CJCians.

The College Chaplain, Father Justin Yip, brought the ceremony to a close with a final blessing to the college. The JC1 leaders left the Auditorium feeling inspired to begin their leadership journey.
