### **CJC’s 47th Annual Awards Ceremony, 8 April 2022**
The 47th Annual Awards Ceremony at Catholic Junior College (CJC) on 8 April this year was truly a homecoming for students and staff in more ways than one. The College came together to celebrate the achievements and tenacity of the Class of 2021 and to give thanks to God for His providence and graces for the year past. It was heartening to be able to celebrate Annual Awards Ceremony in the Auditorium with the CJ Family and invited guests after a break of two years.

Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal, CJC, shared about the different events that saw the CJ community rally together with creativity and a can-do spirit. This was possible only with a faith grounded in God and the collective determination of all CJCians who worked hard to achieve excellence in learning and living in their two-year journey in CJC. Mrs Lim spoke of the many academic and non-academic initiatives borne from teachers’ and students’ desire to co-create meaningful learning experiences that exemplify our College’s mission to develop thinkers with a mission and leaders with a heart. The successful completion of the School of the Future space in CJC and the recently concluded CJCares Virtual Cross Country were examples of such collaborations.

Ms Christina Lim, Class of 1978, Guest-of-Honour of CJC’s 47th College Day, addressing the audience

The prayer service of the ceremony is a key feature of all major College events and this year, it was presided over by our new College Chaplain, Father Justin Yip. The thanksgiving hymn, We Are Called, and the gospel reading from Saint Matthew on the call to be salt and light in the world, were an apt segue to the next segment of the ceremony. The Guest-of-Honour was Ms Christina Lim, from the Class of 1978, entrepreneur and founder of leading health supplements brand, Ocean Health, and medical aesthetic brand, TDF (Therapeutic Dermatologic Formula). Ms Lim had served as the Chairperson of our College’s School Management Committee in 2013-2014 and was a member of CJ’s Parent Support Group for four years.

Ms Lim exhorted CJCians to dare to take risks and accept failures in their stride as they pursue their dreams and goals. When we do what we love, we will love what we do naturally, she added. Ms Lim also touched on the importance of learning to learn, staying resilient in times of crises, and remaining alert to opportunities even when some doors close.

Finally, the ceremony approached its end with the presentation of scholarships, prizes and awards to students and staff members. Notably, the recipient of the prestigious Dr Ee Peng Liang Memorial Award and Ms Narindar K Dhillon Award was Judith Tan (2T03, Class of 2021), who was recognized for her outstanding academic achievements, as well as her service to, and leadership of, the community.

Dr Francis Oen, Chairman of CJC’s School Management Committee and from the Class of 1979, was recognised for his unstinting contributions to CJC and to education in Singapore with the MOE Service to Education Award. Dr Oen also received the Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart award for his selfless contribution to his alma mater. He shared that he is grateful for the honour to serve his College and is even more thankful to all who have helped and supported him, and continue to give back to CJC without reservations, many of whom are content to remain behind-the-scenes.
