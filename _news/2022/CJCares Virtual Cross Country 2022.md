### **CJCares Virtual Cross Country 2022**

<img style="width:75%" src="/images/2022cjcxcountry1.jpg">

As&nbsp;**_Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart_**, CJCians strive to lead and serve and make a positive impact on the community.&nbsp; In line with our ethos as a Catholic college, we are proud to have each cohort of CJCians lead and serve in a wide range of community projects. In doing so, they discover their mission to make a difference in the lives of others.

The recent Covid-19 pandemic and its challenges have not dampened our CJ spirit of leadership and service. Since 2019, we have leveraged on technology to partner local Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) in helping the disadvantaged in society; and reached out to foreign communities in Vietnam and Cambodia to conduct service learning and cross-cultural exchange programmes.&nbsp;

To celebrate the indomitable CJ spirit of leadership and service, CJC will be embarking on our first&nbsp;**CJCares Virtual Cross Country**&nbsp;this year. The cross country will have CJCians, staff, alumni and parent representatives covering a distance of&nbsp;**40,500km**&nbsp;– the circumference of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;The theme:&nbsp;**_“Run for our World, Run for CJ! – One Flame, One Family”_**&nbsp;symbolises CJ’s commitment to build a world without borders, a world of hope. Every step we take is a step of hope, based on our belief that we can, as one CJ Family, overcome all challenges with resilience, in Truth and in Love.

The funds raised from our virtual cross country will go towards the&nbsp;**CJCares Fundraising Campaign**&nbsp;to&nbsp;**support CJCians who need financial assistance in these challenging times**. If you would like to make a&nbsp;**donation**, click on&nbsp;[this link](https://www.giving.sg/catholic-junior-college).

Join us as we let our light spread and brighten the night,

Let our CJ Flame warm all hearts and unite!
