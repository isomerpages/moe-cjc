### **Code of Conduct**
**Guiding Principle:**<br>
As a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart, the CJC student is responsible in thought and action, displaying values and leadership attributes that guide his or her thought and action. The CJC student strives to be the best that he or she can be and in doing so, brings out the best in others.

We believe that all CJC students have the potential for positive change. The CJC student is committed to doing good and makes amends for inappropriate actions. The CJC student exudes self-discipline, personal and social responsibility in the pursuit of his or her goals. As part of a safe and conducive learning community, he or she respects the college’s rules and regulations, as well as the rights of other individuals.

The CJC student is self-aware, able to manage his or her emotions, and is guided by integrity and ethical values to do what is right.

Discipline is a whole college effort.  Everyone has a part to play.
