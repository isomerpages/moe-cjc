### **CJC's e-Open House**

<img src="/images/cjceopenhouse.jpg" style="width:65%">

**Welcome to CJ!!!** 

While our student ambassadors are unable to welcome you in person this year, the warmth and exuberance of our college abound through the pages of our CJC e-Open House microsite – [https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/eopenhouse](https://cjc.moe.edu.sg/eopenhouse), created specially for you. We have several exciting student activities happening live on [Discord](http://discord.gg/cjc-eopenhouse-2022), an interactive channel handled by the Student Council - [http://discord.gg/cjc-eopenhouse-2022](http://discord.gg/cjc-eopenhouse-2022).

The distinct Catholic Junior College (CJC) experience is like no other and you are cordially invited to explore the different academic micro-lessons, learn more about the various departments and our rich student development programmes, and decide on the subject combinations that suit you best.  

What if you are not sure about a particular subject’s demands, or whether the subject is right for you? Fret not. Sign up for a Zoom subject consultation with our department/subject heads using this [link](https://tinyurl.com/cjc2022eohQAoptionform) and fire your questions away on **13** **Jan**. Do note, however, that these [limited subject consultation sessions](https://tinyurl.com/cjc2022eohQAoptionform) are on a first-come, first-served basis, and they are only available on **13 Jan**. 

Our School Leaders, Mrs Phyllis Lim (Principal), and Mrs Poon Wai Chin (VP Academic), have prepared video messages to welcome you to our college’s e-Open House, provide an overview of our academic programmes and the many university and scholarship opportunities that are open to CJCians. Mr Mark Li, Year Head, touches on how our Catholic ethos informs and grounds the student development programmes we have for all students.  

Last, and equally important, are the stories of our CJCians that you find at each turn on our e-Open House microsite. They speak of the experiences of growth and genuine friendships that they have encountered, and these inspire them to overcome all odds, ignite, and shine! 

Come join us at **CJC**, where our students **Ignite, Illuminate,** and **Inspire**!
