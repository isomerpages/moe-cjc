This year, Catholic Junior College (CJC) celebrates 45 years of blessings. We praise and thank God for the manifold blessings He has bestowed upon the college and the many generations of students and staff. To commemorate our 45th anniversary, we will be celebrating the Eucharist on 27th November 2020. Due to COVID-19 safe management measures, the Mass will only be attended by a representative group of students, staff, and members of the School Management Committee. The college invites all our students and staff, past and present, to participate in this celebration by tuning in to the recorded mass which will be made available on [this webpage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH0i-4eyA4g). (tinyurl.com/catholicjc) 

We pray that God continues to bless us with many years of truth and love!
