### **Joint Admissions Exercise and Appeals 2022**
The **Joint Admissions Exercise and Appeals 2022** process has ended on 10 Feb 2022. Our heartiest congratulations to the students who have been posted to Catholic Junior College (CJC) under the JAE exercise. 

CJC continues to be a college of top choice among students. The College has received the maximum number of JC1 students that we are able to accommodate. We thank all parents and students who have chosen CJC.  We would also like to take this opportunity to wish all students the best in their future endeavours and their continual education journey. 

Thank you.
