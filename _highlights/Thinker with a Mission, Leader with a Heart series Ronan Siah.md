Ronan Siah, CJC’s 2019 Arts Valedictorian, received the Harvard Prize Book (Singapore) 2019/20 award in recognition of his altruistic spirit. A long-standing award presented since 1910, the significance of the Harvard Prize Book lies in its support for and encouragement of students with notable promise of becoming service leaders that can inspire others to authentic and sustainable acts of kindness. In his role as the Publicity Head of his Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), the Environmental Science Society, Ronan drove the publicity for projects that pushed for climate action in his college. Ronan frequently made speeches during assembly in order to rally the student cohort to support various environmental programmes initiated by the CCA, such as Earth Day. Ronan also assisted his CCA to collaborate with Public Utilities Board (PUB) Singapore to organize a college-wide initiative to raise awareness on water conservation issues. He represented the college in the ASEAN Plus 3 Youth Environment Forum, a programme aimed to empower youths to have greater practical resolve to implement schemes that would influence others to live green.  

Ronan’s achievement also affirms his dedication to volunteering with the Youth Corps, YMCA, SPCA, and to serving as senior trainer in the NPCC at his alma mater, ACS (Barker). Addressing the distinguished guests and his peers at the Harvard Prize Book ceremony, Ronan shared about caring for the environment, a cause he is deeply passionate about. We are proud of Ronan, whose qualities exemplify the College’s mission – every student becoming a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart – and immensely hopeful that the lives he has touched in CJC will galvanise others to extend the culture of care beyond CJC, to our wider community.
