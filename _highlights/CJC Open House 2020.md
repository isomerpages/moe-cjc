What makes the CJC experience different? Meet the CJC family on 14 January 2020 and witness how our approach to holistic education takes our students on a journey to Ignite, Illuminate, Inspire!  
 'Ignite': Identify your strengths and purpose at CJC.

'Illuminate': Grow as a person at CJC.

'Inspire': Move on to inspire and influence others in CJC and beyond.

Our enthusiastic student ushers will warmly receive you at the foyer with our specially prepared goodie bags, and offer to take you on a tour around the College, to places of interest rich in history and conducive for learning and living. Stop by our ice-cream carts for some sweet refreshment along the way!

At the auditorium, our experienced teachers will be ready to take questions and guide you to explore the various subject combinations, so you can make the choice that is best for you. Waiting during long queues? Subject information boards will be on display for you to learn about the full range of subjects offered, including niche subjects such as English Language and Linguistics, and our academic stretch programme, the Ignite Programme. 

Curious about how the learning culture is like in the classroom? You can choose to attend our micro-lessons to experience CJC’s interactive pedagogy. Before you rush off, don’t forget to catch the Principal’s Talk at the library for the highlights of CJC’s academic and holistic development programmes!

If you are up for more, our students will be happy to share their experiences from their latest overseas service learning and academic trips, instrumental in their development as Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart. You can also see the CJC spirit in action as our Houses and CCAs turn out in full force to give you a sampling of our vibrant, student-led College life. Make some time to catch our stable of talent perform live – our Distinction-winning Performing Arts CCAs are sure to entertain and impress.
