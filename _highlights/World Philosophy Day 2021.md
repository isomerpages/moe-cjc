<b><u>CJC World Philosophy Day Essay Writing Competition - 2021</u></b><br>
**NOTE**: The annual CJC philosophy essay writing competition is open to **all** promoted JC1 students and **all** graduating JC2 students; <br>
Organized in celebration of - **World Philosophy Day, 18th November, 2021**;

The contemporary philosopher, Anthony Grayling, believes that philosophy should play a useful role in society and public policy (not just in academia).  

A philosophy essay by its very nature involves critical thinking, logical reasoning and conceptual analysis skills – as critical thinking and rational argumentation are characteristic methods of philosophical inquiry and analysis.

**Write an essay in response to ONE of the following questions:**<br>
**1) People calling themselves GINKs (Green Inclination, No Kids) – claim we should forgo parenthood because of concerns about the future existence of children on a burning planet. Critically assess this viewpoint.**<br>
**2) How, in your opinion, can we effectively combat the problem posed by conspiracy theories in today’s world?** <br>
**3) ‘There are jobs nobody would ever miss. This would include even highly paid jobs in finance and real estate. An effectively functioning society needs to do away with purposeless work.’ Critically assess this perspective.**<br>
**4) The greatest of all existential threats to humanity over the next century: Artificial Intelligence – given its destructive potential.  Critically assess.**<br>
**5) To ensure the continuation of human flourishing in the 21st century and beyond we need to change our human nature by gene-editing the human genome (notably through the potential use of the gene editing tool CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Critically assess this perspective.**
