### **Prayer for Class of 2021**
Our road to the 2021 A-Level results release has been paved with much striving and exertion, but we pause to find the peace of God within reach and take heart in the knowledge that we're hemmed in on all sides by the prayers and petitions of our community.

Join us to offer a prayer for the Class of 2021: view a recording of our 22 Feb 2022 Thanksgiving Mass for Commencement and 2021 A-Level Results, which was celebrated and recorded in the CJC Chapel.
