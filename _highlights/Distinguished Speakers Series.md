Ambassador Mrs Mary Seet-Cheng with CJC student moderators  
On 7 May 2019, CJC was honoured to host a visit by Mrs Mary Seet-Cheng, Singapore’s Ambassador to the Republic of Panama and Cuba, resident in Singapore. She is also a Senior Specialist Adviser in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Special Adviser to the Maritime Port Authority.  She addressed our JC1 cohort and student leaders on the principles that guide Singapore’s foreign policy and Singapore’s relations with other states on a regional and global level. Many students took the opportunity to tap on Ambassador Seet-Cheng’s wealth of knowledge on foreign and maritime affairs and sought her views on issues related to Singapore’s diplomatic relations with other countries. Ambassador Seet-Cheng’s rich diplomatic experience provided our students valuable insights on the guiding principles of Singapore’s foreign policy, lessons on leadership and the role of women in diplomacy.
