<u>Collection of Examination Results</u><br>
If you are well, you may collect your result slips and examination certificates in the College from 2pm on 22 Feb.

**To avoid intermingling amongst different cohorts of students, the College premises will be opened to 2021 JC2 cohort only from 1pm onwards**. Students who arrive in College early will be asked to return at a later time from 1pm onwards.

**Please be reminded of the national Safe Management Measures (SMM) in place and to continue to be socially responsible.**

You will be required to have your temperature scanned and to do SafeEntry at the Foyer before proceeding to your designated classroom to collect your results. 

If you are unwell or are required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result (Ag+ or PCR+) on 22 February 2022, **please do not come to the College to collect your results. You are to abide strictly with MOH’s Health Protocols 1 and 2.**

If you are served a MOH’s Health Risk Warning (HRW) SMS for 7-day ART monitoring under Protocol 3, that is, if you are a close contact of a COVID-19 case, you are legally required to self-isolate immediately and take an ART self-test within 24 hours. You must ensure you have a negative ART result on the day of release of results before coming to College.

**NB**: From 18 Feb 2022, a Health Risk Notice (HRN) will replace the Health Risk Warning (HRW). With this change, the self-monitoring period will be reduced from seven to five days.

*   **For PCR positive (C+) household member (HHM).** You are to inform your C+ HHM to submit names in same household to MOH to be issued HRW. While waiting for HRW, you can perform a self-administered ART test prior to leaving home to ensure that you are not Ag+, before coming to the College.

*   **For ART positive (Ag+) HHM.** You may leave home in line with MOH’s requirements that allows you to do so. Please perform a self-administered ART test prior to leaving home to ensure that you are not Ag+, before coming to the College.
