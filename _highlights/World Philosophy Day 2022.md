<b><u>CJC World Philosophy Day Essay Writing Competition - 2022</u></b><br>
**NOTE**: The annual CJC philosophy essay writing competition is open to **all** JC1 Students promoted to JC2.                                                                                    

Organized in celebration of - **World Philosophy Day, 17th November, 2022**;                          

The contemporary philosopher, Anthony Grayling, believes that philosophy should play a useful role in society and public policy (not just in academia).  

A philosophy essay by its very nature involves critical thinking, logical reasoning and conceptual analysis skills – as critical thinking and rational argumentation are characteristic methods of philosophical inquiry and analysis.

**Write an essay in response to ONE of the following questions:**<br>
**1) Given that everyone is born into a ‘Climate of Opinion’, to what extent can one take credit for one’s beliefs?** <br>
**2) Here is a modern argument for skepticism about the external world:**<br>
**- Premise 1: You can’t know you are not in a computer simulation;**<br>
**- Premise 2: If you cannot know you are not in a computer simulation, you can’t know anything about the external world;**<br>
**Conclusion: Therefore, you can’t know anything about the external world.** <br>
**Critically assess the plausibility of this argument.**<br>
**3) Can a critical and acute observer in the modern world avoid being thoroughly deceived by deep fakes?**<br>
**4) A single political model (mode of government) cannot function in all cultures. (A view also held by Lee Kuan Yew) Critically assess this perspective.**<br>
**5) ‘We are moving inexorably towards a surveillance society – Everywhere.’ Can we ensure that society benefits from this seemingly unstoppable trend?**
