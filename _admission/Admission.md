At Catholic Junior College, our students take a two-year course leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level examination. More than a school, **we offer a holistic education for life.** We want you to discover new ideas, think critically about them and find your purpose.  
  
**We are an inclusive community** that welcomes you regardless of your background. Attendance at Catholic activities is not compulsory. We believe in being open to different perspectives and opinions - this is the spirit of a CJC education.
