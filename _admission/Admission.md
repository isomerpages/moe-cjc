At Catholic Junior College, our students take a two-year course leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level examination. More than a school, **we offer a holistic education for life.** We want you to discover new ideas, think critically about them and find your purpose.  
  
**We are an inclusive community** that welcomes you regardless of your background. Attendance at Catholic activities is not compulsory. We believe in being open to different perspectives and opinions - this is the spirit of a CJC education.

Here you will find information on how to enrol via the **[Joint Admissions Exercise](https://moe-cjc-staging.netlify.app/admission/jae/)** / **[Appeals](https://moe-cjc-staging.netlify.app/admission/jae-appeal-2023/)** (JAE), Direct Admissions Exercise (DSA) and application criteria. For prospective and current students, details on subject combinations, scholarships, financial assistance, higher education and career prospects can be accessed here at our admissions site.
