### **Financial Aid**
The college is committed to ensuring that all students have a fair opportunity to realise their potential. The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, CJC Needy Student Fund and the Internationalisation Fund provide students with the necessary resources as well as the opportunity to take up enrichment activities beyond local shores.

#### **MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS)**
We offer the Ministry of Education Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS) to needy Singapore Citizen students in Government or Government-aided schools so that all Singaporeans, regardless of their financial background, can benefit from the best opportunities in education.

*   Gross Household Income (GHI) not exceeding $3,000 per month **OR**

#### **Income Family Micro-Insurance and Savings Scheme (IFMISS)**
For pupils attending a local Government or Government-aided primary school and is an MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE-FAS) recipient: 

NTUC Income (Income) understands the difficulties that a child may go through when death or total and permanent disability occurs to a parent or guardian. As such, they have developed the Income Family Micro-Insurance and Savings Scheme (IFMISS) to help students from pre-school to pre-university institutions with disadvantaged backgrounds cope financially in such times of need.
