### The Decision-Making Process

Please refer to the website via the link given below to guide you through the process of selecting your subject combination: 
<br>
[CJC Potential Development](https://go.gov.sg/jc1-subj-select)&nbsp;

In summary, do take into consideration the following when deciding on your subject combination:

*   Your level of interest in the subjects
    
*   Your talents &amp; aspirations
    
*   The University pre-requisites of your possible degree choices
    
*   Understand more by listening to the senior’s recorded sharings on the website, speaking to your seniors and our Education &amp; Career Guidance Counselor, Ms Joys Lin. You are **strongly encouraged** to make an appointment with Ms Joys Lin via this link [https://go.gov.sg/ecgcjc](https://go.gov.sg/ecgcjc)&nbsp;&nbsp;


### Combination Choice

The details of the subject combinations offered to all new students in 2024 are available on our college website: [CJC Academic Information](https://go.gov.sg/cjc-subject-combinations-2024)&nbsp;

  

This microsite also provides details of

*   College’s Signature Programmes
    
*   Department and Subject Information; including Microlesson(s) to give you an experience of the subject matter, complexity and learning approach of the subject&nbsp;
<br><br>
Please study the requirements for each subject carefully so that you can make an informed choice on the most appropriate subject combination that can cater to your interests and aspirations.
<br><br>
Posting to a subject combination is subject to the student's knowledge and understanding of the relevant subject(s) at O-Level, the performance in the subject(s) and availability of vacancies.&nbsp;  

### Subject Registration Exercise

As part of the orientation programme, we have scheduled a “Subject Registration Briefing” on 2 Feb to provide more information on the subject selection process and the subject choices to help you make an informed decision on your subject combination.

  

Additionally, there will be a sharing session on 14 Feb for JC1s to hear from your JC2 seniors on different aspects of JC life. The purpose of this sharing is for your seniors to relate their vibrant experiences and share tips on how you can tap on the many platforms available, to uncover your preferences, abilities, and interests both in your subject selection and “out-of-the classroom” experiences for a vibrant and holistic student life.&nbsp;

  

Through these avenues, we hope that you will start your CJ experience with an overview of how the different components of JC life - both inside and outside the classroom - can help you discover more about yourself, and in so doing, empower you&nbsp; to discover your purpose and passions. It all begins with the first step of selecting your subjects.

  

Therefore, please consider your subject combination selection carefully in consultation with your parents. **You need to register your subject combination choices using the CJC Portal from Friday 2 Feb to Monday, 5 Feb**. More details will be provided during the “Subject Registration Briefing” on 2 Feb.

  

The subject combination and class allocations will be released to all JC1s on 9 Feb, 9pm (tentative) via the CJC Portal. This is followed by the Matriculation period which allows students to begin their academic journey based on their allocated subject combination.&nbsp;
  

### Matriculation Week (14 to 23 Feb)

Following the subject selection exercise, students will begin attending lessons for their allocated subjects to get an understanding of the demands and expectations of the subjects during the Matriculation Week.&nbsp;

  

The Matriculation Week Timetable will be shared with the J1 students upon the allocation of classes on 9 Feb.
