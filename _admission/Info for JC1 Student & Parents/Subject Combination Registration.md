<h4>The Decision-Making Process</h4>
<p>Informed decision-making is a skill you will develop throughout your time
with us and is an essential part of our educational approach. In facilitating
your decision making do refer to the following resource to guide you through
the process of selecting your subject combination.</p>
<p>Please refer to the website via the link given below to guide you through

</p>
<p>In summary, do take into consideration the following when deciding on
your subject combination:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your level of interest in the subjects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your talents &amp; aspirations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The University pre-requisites of your possible degree choices</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Understand more by listening to the senior’s recorded sharings on the
website, speaking to your seniors and our Senior Education &amp; Career
Guidance Counselor, Ms Joys Lin. You are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to

<h4>Combination Choice</h4>
<p>The details of the subject combinations offered to all new students in
2026 are available on our college website: <a href="https://www.cjc.moe.edu.sg/admission/subject-combinations/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CJC Academic Information</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This <a href="https://cjcopenhouse.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">microsite</a> also
provides details of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>College’s Signature Programmes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Department and Subject Information; including Microlesson(s) to give you
an experience of the subject matter, complexity and learning approach of
the subject&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please study the requirements for each subject carefully so that you can
make an informed choice on the most appropriate subject combination that
can cater to your interests and aspirations.</p>
<p>Posting to a subject combination is subject to the student's knowledge
and understanding of the relevant subject(s) at O-Level, the performance
in the subject(s) and availability of vacancies.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Subject Registration Exercise</h4>
<p>As part of the orientation programme, we have scheduled a “Subject Registration
Briefing” on 4 Feb to provide more information on the subject selection
process and the subject choices to help you make an informed decision on
your subject combination.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be a sharing session for JC1s to hear from your
JC2 seniors on different aspects of JC life. The purpose of this sharing
is for your seniors to relate their vibrant experiences and share tips
on how you can tap on the many platforms available, to uncover your preferences,
abilities, and interests both in your subject selection and “out-of-the
classroom” experiences for a vibrant and holistic student life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these avenues, we hope that you will start your CJ experience
with an overview of how the different components of JC life - both inside
and outside the classroom - can help you discover more about yourself,
and in so doing, empower you&nbsp; to discover your purpose and passions.
It all begins with the first step of selecting your subjects.</p>
<p>Therefore, please consider your subject combination selection carefully
in consultation with your parents. You need to<strong> register your subject combination choices using the CJC Portal from Tuesday, 3 Feb to Saturday, 7 Feb</strong>.
More details will be provided during the “Subject Registration Briefing”
on 4 Feb.</p>
<p>The subject combination and class allocations will be released to all
JC1s on 10 Feb, 9pm (tentative) via the CJC Portal. This is followed by
the Matriculation period which allows students to begin their academic
journey based on their allocated subject combination.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Matriculation Week (9 to 13 Feb)</h4>
<p>Following the subject selection exercise, students will begin attending
lessons for their allocated subjects to get an understanding of the demands
and expectations of the subjects during the Matriculation Week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Matriculation Week Timetable will be shared with the J1 students upon
the allocation of classes on 10 Feb.&nbsp;</p>
