### **Subject Combination Registration**
#### **The Decision-Making Process**
Please refer to the website via the link given below to guide you through the process of selecting your subject combination:
<br>[CJC Potential Development](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/subjectcombinationselection/jc1-subject-selection)
<br>In summary, do take into consideration the following when deciding on your subject combination:
* Your level of interest in the subjects
* Your talents &amp; aspirations
* The University Prerequisites of your possible degree choices
* Understand more by listening &amp; speaking to your seniors and our Education &amp; Career Guidance Counsellor, Ms Joys Lin. You may make an appointment via this link&nbsp;[https://go.gov.sg/ecgcjc](https://go.gov.sg/ecgcjc)

#### **Combination Choice**
The details of the subject combinations offered to all new students in 2023 are available on our college microsite:&nbsp;[CJC e-Open House microsite](https://cjcopenhouse.moe.edu.sg/eopenhouse/academic-information/subject-combinations/)

This microsite also provides details of
* College’s Signature Programmes
* Department and Subject Information; including Microlesson(s) to give you an experience of the subject matter, complexity and learning approach of the subject

Please study the requirements for each subject carefully so that you can make an informed choice on the most appropriate subject combination that can cater to your interests and aspirations.

Posting to a subject combination is subject to the student's knowledge and understanding of the relevant subject(s) at O-Level, the performance in the subject(s) and availability of vacancies.

#### **Subject Registration Exercise**
As part of the orientation programme, we have scheduled a “Subject Registration Briefing” on 3 Feb to provide more information on the subject selection process and the subject choices to help you make an informed decision on your subject combination.

To help you make a more informed choice, JC1s can access recorded sharings of seniors&nbsp;at&nbsp;[our CJC Potential Development wikisite](https://go.gov.sg/jc1-subj-select)&nbsp;doing different subject combinations, and pose your questions via padlet. In this way, you will get a better understanding of the joys, and challenges of taking up the different subject combinations.&nbsp;

As Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) helps you to make sense of your entire JC life, there will be an ECG Sharing session on 10 Feb for JC1s to hear from our JC2 seniors on different aspects of CJ Life. The purpose is for your seniors to relate their experiences and share tips on how you can tap on the many platforms available, to uncover your preferences, abilities, and interests.&nbsp;

Through these avenues, we hope that you will start your CJ experience with an overview of how the different components of JC life can help you to uncover the ECG Big Question 1 of "Who am I", and dive deeper into specific subject combinations of interest, aspirations and based on your individual strengths.&nbsp;

Please make your subject combination selection in consultation with your parents. You need to register your subject combination choices using the CJC Portal from 3pm on Friday, 3 Feb to 9am on Monday, 6 Feb. More details will be provided during the “Subject Registration Briefing” on 3 Feb.&nbsp;

The subject combination and class allocations will be released to all JC1s on 9 Feb, 9pm (tentative)&nbsp;via the CJC Portal. This is followed by the Matriculation period which allows students to begin their academic journey based on their allocated subject combination.

#### **Matriculation Week (10 to 17 Feb)**
Following the subject selection exercise, students will begin attending lessons for their allocated subjects to get an understanding of the demands and expectations of the subjects in preparation for their GCE A-Level examinations during the Matriculation Week.

The Matriculation Week Timetable will be shared with the J1 students upon the allocation of classes.
