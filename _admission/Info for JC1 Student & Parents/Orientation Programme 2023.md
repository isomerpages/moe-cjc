### **Orientation Programme 2023**
#### **Orientation 2023 (3 to 9 February 2023)**
In order to help our new students settle in, the college has specially organised an Orientation Programme for all JC1 students joining the school. JC1 students are expected to participate actively in the Orientation activities so that you will be able to familiarise yourself with the college’s academic and co-curricular programmes, interact and bond with your seniors and other JC1 students. We look forward to seeing you at Orientation. Please take note of the following details:

*   The morning assembly begins at 7.40am daily during Orientation. Please report by 7.35am at the Auditorium. You are expected to be punctual for all activities and functions. Attendance will be marked at the beginning and end of each day.
*   Should you feel unwell, please inform the teacher-in-charge and your Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs).
*   If you have just been vaccinated, please inform your OGLs, and you will sit out any physically strenuous activities for 2 weeks after your vaccination.
