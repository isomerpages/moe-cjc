<h3><strong>Instructions for 1st Day of School:</strong></h3>
<p>We believe as young adults, all students recognise the importance of presenting
oneself well and can exercise self-leadership in managing appearance and
attire. Therefore, all students should ensure that you are neatly and appropriately
attired in your secondary school uniform. Your hair should also be neat
and tidy – dyed hair and multiple earrings are not permitted. Please also
bring your PE attire to change into for Orientation games and a water bottle.</p>
<p>You should have received a text message with the Orientation Group (OG)
assignment. Upon your arrival, kindly report directly to the CJC Auditorium
by 7.30am on Wednesday, 4 February 2026. Please be mindful that traffic
during peak hours can be unpredictable and there are roadworks outside
the college presently along Whitley Road, so we encourage you to plan extra
travel time to avoid delays.</p>
<p>If you have a pre-existing medical condition that may require you to avoid
physically strenuous activities, please input the information in CJ Portal
and let your OGLs and teachers know as well. Your safety is paramount and
it is important for you to inform and seek advice from the teachers prior
to engaging in any physically demanding parts of the Orientation programme.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend on Wednesday, 4 February, please reach out
to us at 6252 4083/4 or via email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:catholic_jc@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">catholic_jc@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;to
confirm your acceptance of the college place. We will provide further instructions
on your next steps.</p>
