<h3><strong>Year Head’s Message</strong></h3>
<p>Dear JC1s,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Catholic Junior College (CJC). We are glad you are with
us and we look forward to journeying with you as you grow in your talents,
interests and strengths. At CJC, we believe that every student has the
potential to be developed as a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.
This is the mission of the college and our promise to you. There will be
opportunities and challenges, high points and low points. As a CJCian,
you are called to be present in each moment, to reflect and grow as part
of your development and to harness this growth to contribute to the common
good. This is the standard we believe each and everyone of you is capable
of.</p>
<p>To enable you to gain a better sense of the college culture, subjects
offered, co-curricular experiences, and of course, very importantly to
make new friends, we have planned a very special Orientation programme
for all of you from 4 to 6 February. You can refer to the Orientation Programme
2026 tab for more details. &nbsp;Following Orientation, we have a Matriculation
week in CJC from 9 to 13 February where you will meet your new classmates
based on the subject combinations you are admitted to. During Matriculation
week, you will experience lessons and bonding activities as a class. This
will enable the class to start on a strong footing academically and socially,
which leads to a culture of learning excellence and strong friendships.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need further clarification, do not hesitate
to approach me or the Assistant Year Head, Ms Chan Sok Yee. You may also
email us at <a href="mailto:dcruz_lucas_anil@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">dcruz_lucas_anil@moe.edu.sg</a> &nbsp;and
<a href="mailto:chan_sok_yee@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">chan_sok_yee@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you in person tomorrow. In the meantime, do
refer to the tab titled “<em>Instructions before reporting on first day of School”</em> to
understand what you need to prepare before you report to CJC tomorrow.</p>
<p>Warmly,</p>
<p><strong>Mr Lucas D’cruz</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JC1 Year Head</strong>
