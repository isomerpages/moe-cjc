## Year Headâ€™s Message

Dear JC1s,

Welcome to CJ!

To help you settle into college and kick start your JC journey, we have curated an Orientation and Matriculation Programme in the coming weeks. Orientation provides you with a platform to get to know the school, the CJ community and make new friends. While the Matriculation Week will provide you with a more immersive experience of the life of a JC student in CJ.

Please find the information required for your first day of reporting (2 February 2024) and details of the orientation programme below.

Should you have any enquiries do feel free to approach me. I look forward to meeting you on Friday!&nbsp;

  

Sincerely,
<br>
Mr Mark Li
<br>
JC1 Year Head
