<h2>Year Head’s Message</h2>
<p>Dear JC1s,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Catholic Junior College (CJC)!</p>
<p>We are excited to have you join our CJ family. To help you settle into
college life and embark on your JC journey, we have thoughtfully curated
a comprehensive Orientation and Matriculation Programme for you in the
coming weeks. Orientation will provide you with the opportunity to explore
the school, get to know the CJ community, and make new friends, while Matriculation
Week will offer a deeper, more immersive experience of what it means to
be a JC student at CJC.</p>
<p>Please find below the essential information you’ll need for your first
day of reporting (5 February, 2025), along with the full details of the
Orientation Programme.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need further clarification, do not hesitate
to approach me. I look forward to meeting you on Wednesday, and I’m excited
for the journey we will take together in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><strong>Mr Marimuthu Sandanam </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JC1 Year Head</strong>
