<h3><strong>Year Head’s Message</strong></h3>
<p>Dear JC1s,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Catholic Junior College (CJC)!</p>
<p>We are excited to have you join our CJ family. To help you settle into
college life and embark on your JC journey, we have thoughtfully curated
an immersive Orientation and Matriculation Programme for you. Orientation
will provide you with the opportunity to explore the college, get to know
the CJ community, and make new friends, while Matriculation Week will offer
a deeper, more immersive experience of what it means to be a JC student
at CJC.</p>
<p>Please find below the essential information you will need for your first
day of reporting (4 February, 2026), along with details of the Orientation
Programme.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need further clarification, do not hesitate
to approach me or the Assistant Year Head, Ms Chan Sok Yee. I look forward
to meeting you on Wednesday and I’m excited for the journey we will take
together in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><strong>Mr Lucas D’Cruz</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>JC1 Year Head</strong>
