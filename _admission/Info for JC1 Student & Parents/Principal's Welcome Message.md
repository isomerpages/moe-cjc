### **Principal's Welcome Message**

Dear J1 CJCians,

         A warm welcome to Catholic Junior College (CJC)! On behalf of the staff and J2 seniors, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our CJ family.  While you enter CJC from a diversity of secondary school backgrounds, you will forge strong ties with your fellow J1s and J2 seniors under the love and guidance of teachers to emerge as members of one CJC family.

To welcome you and to bind strong bonds of friendships amongst you, your seniors, the Student Councilors and Orientation Group Leaders, have spent the last two months curating the J1 Orientation, themed Odyssey: Unleash Your Potential, for you. I encourage you to fully immerse in the exciting time travel adventures, get to know CJC and your fellow J1s and forge strong friendships. The Orientation is but a start to your two-year journey of discovering your strengths and passion. I strongly encourage you to give of your best and be totally participative in all of our college’s programmes for you to develop your potential aligned to our college motto, In Veritate et Caritate, which means In Truth and Love, ready to become thinkers with a mission, leaders with a heart when you graduate from CJC.

I look forward to welcoming you to CJC on 2 February; and I wish you an exciting Orientation and an exhilarating and fulfilling JC learning journey ahead.

Warmest regards,


Mrs Woo Soo Min

Principal
