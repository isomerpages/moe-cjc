### **Principal's Welcome Message**

Dear J1 CJCians,

A warm welcome to Catholic Junior College (CJC)! On behalf of the staff and J2 seniors, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our CJ family.  While you enter CJC from a diversity of secondary school backgrounds, you will forge strong ties with your fellow J1s and J2 seniors under the love and guidance of teachers to emerge as members of one CJC family.

To welcome you and to bind strong bonds of friendships amongst you, your seniors, the Student Councilors and Orientation Group Leaders, have spent the last two months curating the J1 Orientation, themed Oikos: Together We Thrive, for you. I encourage you to fully immerse in the exciting time travel adventures, get to know CJC and your fellow J1s and forge strong friendships.

The Orientation is but a start to your two-year journey of discovering your strengths and passion. I strongly encourage you to give of your best and be totally participative in all of our college’s programmes for you to develop your potential aligned to our college motto, In Veritate et Caritate, which means In Truth and Love, ready to become Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart when you graduate from CJC.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of our college. This milestone is significant as it marks CJC’s provision of a quality pre-university education in a Christ-centred environment, one where all are called to respect the human dignity of self and others, give of one’s self to build the common good in solidarity with others. CJC’s vision is to be a place of excellence in learning and living. We welcome you, our new JC1 students, to join us in our CJ family to give of your best to learn and live in harmony with others.  Let us come together to celebrate the traditions, achievements, and enduring spirit that have shaped our college for half a century, while eagerly anticipating the journey ahead. A series of events will be held throughout the year to commemorate this incredible milestone and we encourage all our JC1 students to be fully immersed participating in all of them!

I look forward to welcoming you to CJC on 5 February; and I wish you an exciting Orientation and an exhilarating and fulfilling JC learning journey ahead.

In Veritate et Caritate

Mrs Woo Soo Min
