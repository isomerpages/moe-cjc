<h3><strong>Principal's Welcome Message</strong></h3>
<p>Dear JC1 CJCians,</p>
<p>A warm welcome to Catholic Junior College (CJC)! On behalf of the staff
and JC2 seniors, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our CJ family.&nbsp;
While you enter CJC from a diversity of secondary school backgrounds, you
will forge strong ties with your fellow JC1s and JC2 seniors under the
love and guidance of teachers to emerge as members of one CJC family.</p>
<p>To welcome you and to bind strong bonds of friendships amongst you, your
seniors, the Student Councilors and Orientation Group Leaders, have spent
the last two months curating the JC1 Orientation, themed <strong><em>Oikos: Together We Thrive</em></strong>,
for you. I encourage you to fully immerse in the exciting time travel adventures,
get to know CJC and your fellow JC1s and forge strong friendships.</p>
<p>The Orientation is but a start to your two-year journey of discovering
your strengths and passion. I strongly encourage you to give of your best
and be totally participative in all of our college’s programmes for you
to develop your potential aligned to our college motto, In Veritate et
Caritate, which means In Truth and Love, ready to become <strong><em>Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart</em></strong> when
you graduate from CJC.</p>
<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of our college. This milestone is
significant as it marks CJC’s provision of a quality pre-university education
in a Christ-centred environment, one where all are called to respect the
human dignity of self and others, give of one’s self to build the common
good in solidarity with others. CJC’s vision is to be a place of excellence
in learning and living. We welcome you, our new JC1 students, to join us
in our CJ family to give of your best to learn and live in harmony with
others.&nbsp; Let us come together to celebrate the traditions, achievements,
and enduring spirit that have shaped our college for half a century, while
eagerly anticipating the journey ahead. A series of events will be held
throughout the year to commemorate this incredible milestone and we encourage
all our JC1 students to be fully immersed participating in all of them!</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming you to CJC on 5 February; and I wish you an
exciting Orientation and an exhilarating and fulfilling JC learning journey
ahead.</p>
<p><em>In Veritate et Caritate</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Woo Soo Min</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Principal</strong>
