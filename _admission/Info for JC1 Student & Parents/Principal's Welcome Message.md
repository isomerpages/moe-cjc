### **Principal's Welcome Message**
Dear JC1s,

A warm welcome to Catholic Junior College (CJC)! On behalf of the teachers, staff and J2 seniors, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our CJ family.&nbsp; We hope that the information contained in this orientation package will be useful in helping you kick start your exciting journey in CJC.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your JC1 journey in CJC will begin with the Orientation Programme, held from Friday, 2 February to Thursday, 8 February 2024. The Student Councilors and Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) have planned an exciting programme for you to learn more about our college, our key programmes and to make new friends. The theme for this year’s Orientation Programme is **_“Odyssey: Unleash Your Potential”,_** _and centres around a time travelling adventure through different time periods_. We hope that you will discover your strengths in CJC and unleash your full potential in pursuit of your passion,&nbsp; in terms of developing as thinkers with a mission and leaders with a heart.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please take note that if you have a pre-existing medical condition that requires you to be excused from physically strenuous activities, do inform the College and seek advice before participating in physically demanding segments of orientation programme. In addition, take note that students have to avoid physically strenuous activities for at least two weeks after testing covid positive or after receiving the Covid vaccination.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You would have received the Orientation Group (OG) you have been assigned to via SMS. Alternatively, you may check the display boards at the lower foyer for the Orientation Group (OG) and OG facilitators you have been assigned to when you arrive in the college. All students have to report to CJC punctually by **7.30am on Friday, 2 February 2024**.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to welcoming you to CJC on 2 February; and I wish you an exciting Orientation Programme and a rich and fulfilling JC1 journey ahead.

Warmest regards,<br>
Mrs Woo Soo Min<br>
Principal
