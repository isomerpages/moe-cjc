<h3><strong>Principal's Welcome Message</strong></h3>
<p>Dear CJCians</p>
<p>Welcome to Catholic Junior College, the only Catholic mission JC in Singapore
founded in 1975 to offer a quality junior college education to affiliated
and non-affiliated students, in a caring and enabling environment anchored
on Catholic ethos.</p>
<p>2025 was a very special year as it marked the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary
of CJC’s founding.&nbsp; As we enter into 2026 and the next chapter of
CJC’s history and development, it is timely that MOE has announced in 2025
of plans for CJC to be in phase 2 of the JC Rejuvenation Plan. We are excited
and hopeful that CJC’s rejuvenation will boost CJC’s capacity to provide
an exciting JC education, anchored on Catholic values and ethos to all
students. To leverage the opportunities available at Punggol, we have signed
Memorandums of Understanding with key partners to curate programmes for
CJCians. Some of the programmes have already started and more will be offered
when ready. We hope to build lasting partnerships with our neighbours and
avail the opportunities to you now even though our move to Punggol is tentatively
in 2034.</p>
<p>In CJC, you would learn and grow together in an environment of care, love
and respect, guided by the college motto, <em>In Veritate et Caritate</em>,
which means, In Truth and Love.&nbsp; As students of a college that is
known for its culture of care and its culture of excellence in learning
and living, you can expect to be developed to your full potential in a
nurturing environment.&nbsp; Through your CJC Experience, you will discover
the truth about yourselves and about God and learn to appreciate your gifts.&nbsp;
We hope you will be a gift to others in our community and be present to
their needs and in giving of yourselves, you dignify others through your
respect, care and friendship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may come as students from diverse backgrounds.&nbsp; It is our deep
belief that in being a participative member of the CJC family and in all
of college life, you have what it takes to enhance our college ethos through
respecting the dignity of self and others, working in solidarity with others
for the common good and in so doing, strengthen the college identity and
spirit, and graduate as Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart!</p>
<p>God bless!</p>
<p><em>In Veritate et Caritate</em>
</p>
