<h4>Setting up of the CJ Portal Account and Subject Registration</h4>
<p>A CJ Portal Account is needed to facilitate your enrollment into CJC,
so fill in all relevant information, with the final step being to submit
your subject combination before you report to CJC tomorrow, 4 Feb. A guide
on how to set up your CJ Portal account is attached below.</p>
<p>Rest assured, you are able to continue amending your subject combination
on 4 and 5 Feb even after submitting your subject combination. As part
of the Orientation Programme, you will be attending subject briefings on
4 Feb to facilitate your decision-making process. Your Orientation Group
Leaders, who are your JC2 seniors and teachers who are with you will also
helpfully respond to queries you have.</p>
