<h4>Setting up of the CJ Portal Account and Subject Registration</h4>
<p>A CJ Portal Account is needed to facilitate your enrollment into CJC,
so fill in all relevant information, with the final step being to submit
your subject combination before you report to CJC tomorrow, 4 Feb. Please
refer to the attached guide on how to set up your CJ Portal account, fill
in all relevant information and submit your subject combination.</p>
<p>Rest assured, you are able to continue amending your subject combination
on 4 and 5 Feb even after submitting your subject combination today, 3
Feb. As part of the Orientation Programme, you will be attending subject
briefings on 4 Feb to facilitate your decision-making process. Your Orientation
Group Leaders, who are your JC2 seniors and teachers who are with you will
also helpfully respond to queries you have.</p>
