<h3>Information on Finance Matters</h3>
<p>All parents are encouraged to set up GIRO and Edusave Standing Orders
(for Singapore Citizens only) for a seamless process of making payments
for your child’s school and miscellaneous fees. For detailed step-by step
instructions on how to apply eGIRO, please visit the Ministry of Education
(MOE) website using the link below:</p>

<p>We encourage parents to review the information provided on the MOE website
to ensure a smooth application process.&nbsp;</p>

fees and enrichment programmes, you are required to submit an online Standing
Order form. This can be done using either parent’s SingPass login.</p>
