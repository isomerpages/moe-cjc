<h3>Information on Finance Matters</h3>
<p>All parents are encouraged to set up GIRO and Edusave Standing Orders
(for Singapore Citizens only) for a seamless process of making payments
for your child’s school and miscellaneous fees. For detailed step-by step
instructions on how to apply eGIRO, please visit the Ministry of Education
(MOE) website using the link below:</p>

</p>
<p>We encourage parents to review the information provided on the MOE website
to ensure a smooth application process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For parents who wish to use your child’s Edusave funds to pay for approved
fees and enrichment programmes, you are required to submit an online Standing
Order form. This can be done using either parent’s SingPass login.</p>
