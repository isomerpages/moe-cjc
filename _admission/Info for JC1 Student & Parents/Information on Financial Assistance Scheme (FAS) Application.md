### **Financial Aid**
The college is committed to ensuring that all students have a fair opportunity to realise their potential. The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme, CJC Needy Student Fund and the Internationalisation Fund provide students with the necessary resources as well as the opportunity to take up enrichment activities beyond local shores.

#### **MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS)**
We offer the Ministry of Education Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS) to needy Singapore Citizen students in Government or Government-aided schools so that all Singaporeans, regardless of their financial background, can benefit from the best opportunities in education.  

Under the ministry's guidelines, a student is eligible for MOE FAS if he or she meets either of the following criteria:

*   Gross Household Income (GHI) not exceeding $3,000 per month **O****R**
*   Per Capita Income (PCI) not exceeding $750 per month

The benefits of the scheme for junior college students are:

*   Full waiver of standard miscellaneous fees ($13.50 per month)
*   Bursary ($1200)
*   Transport Subsidy ($17 per month, up to $204 per annum for students taking public transport)

#### **Income Family Micro-Insurance and Savings Scheme (IFMISS)**
For pupils attending a local Government or Government-aided primary school and is an MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE-FAS) recipient: 

NTUC Income (Income) understands the difficulties that a child may go through when death or total and permanent disability occurs to a parent or guardian. As such, they have developed the Income Family Micro-Insurance and Savings Scheme (IFMISS) to help students from pre-school to pre-university institutions with disadvantaged backgrounds cope financially in such times of need.
