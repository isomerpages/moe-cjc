<h3><strong>Orientation Programme 2025</strong></h3>
<h4>5 to 11 February 2025</h4>
<p>To welcome our new students and help you settle into the CJC family, the
college has specially organised an Orientation Programme for all JC1 students
joining the school. JC1 students are expected to participate actively in
the Orientation activities so that you can familiarise yourself with the
college’s academic and co-curricular programmes as well as bond with your
seniors and other JC1 students.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Please take note of the following details:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Morning assembly begins at 7.40am daily during Orientation. Please report
by 7.30am at the Auditorium.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are expected to be present and punctual for all activities. Attendance
will be marked at the beginning and end of each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be some costs incurred in the running of the Orientation Programme,
namely (1) transportation costs out of CJC on Day 4 for “The Great Expedition”,
(2) light refreshments on Day 4 and Day 5, and (3) a collar pin that you
will receive during the JC1 Commencement Ceremony. The total cost of these
items is $8.50, and you can pay for it via either Edusave, your parent’s
GIRO, or an AXS transfer. Payment can be made upon receiving the school
bill.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you feel unwell during the activities and/or need to leave the
programme early for official reasons (e.g. medical appointments), please
inform the teacher-in-charge and your Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs).
