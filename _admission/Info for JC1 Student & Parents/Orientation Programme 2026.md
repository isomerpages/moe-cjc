<h4>4 to 6 February 2026 (Orientation)</h4>
<h4>9 to 13 February 2026 (Matriculation)</h4>
<p>To welcome our new students and help you settle into the CJC family, the
college has specially organised an Orientation and Matriculation Programme
for all JC1 students joining the school. JC1 students are expected to participate
actively in the activities so that you can familiarise yourself with the
college’s academic and co-curricular programmes as well as bond with your
seniors and other JC1 students.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Please take note of the following details:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Morning assembly begins at 7.40am daily during Orientation and Matriculation.
Please report by 7.30am at the Auditorium.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are expected to be present and punctual for all activities. Attendance
will be marked at the beginning and end of each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some costs associated with the Orientation and Matriculation
programme. Each student will be charged $9.70 which covers: (i) transport
out of CJC for “The Great Expedition” on 13 Feb, (ii) light refreshments
during the “The Great Expedition”, and (iii) a collar pin, which will be
part of your school uniform.</p>

<p>Should you feel unwell during the activities and/or need to leave the
programme early for official reasons (e.g. medical appointments), please
