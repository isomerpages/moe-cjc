<p>At Catholic Junior College, our students take a two-year course leading
to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level examination. More than a school,&nbsp;<strong>we offer a holistic education for life</strong>.
We want you to discover new ideas, think critically about them and find
your purpose.</p>
<p><strong>We are an inclusive community</strong>&nbsp;that welcomes you
regardless of your background. Attendance at Catholic activities is not
compulsory. We believe in being open to different perspectives and opinions
- this is the spirit of a CJC education.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We expect the highest academic performance and the most sensitive social
and spiritual response from all of our students. What we do expect of you,
whether you have 5 or 19 points, is that you be men and women who put service
before self and that you be kind to others. By that and only by that criterion
shall our college be truly Catholic Junior College." -Ee Peng Liang, Chairman,
CJC Management Committee (1975).</p>
