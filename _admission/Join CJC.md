At Catholic Junior College, our students take a two-year course leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level examination. More than a school,&nbsp;**we offer a holistic education for life.**&nbsp;We want you to discover new ideas, think critically about them and find your purpose.  
  
**We are an inclusive community**&nbsp;that welcomes you regardless of your background. Attendance at Catholic activities is not compulsory. We believe in being open to different perspectives and opinions - this is the spirit of a CJC education.

We count actors, doctors, lawyers, business owners, priests, singers, writers, scientists and soldiers amongst our proud alumni. Whatever your calling, our mission is to guide you to make your dream a reality.&nbsp;**We believe you have the potential to make the world a better place.**
