### **Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart: Valsalan Nivish, 2022**

<img src="/images/twm11.jpg" style="width:85%">

Congratulations to Valsalan Nivish, Class of 2022, for receiving the Harvard Prize Book (Singapore) 2022/23 award, presented to promising students all around the world who go beyond the call of duty to show kindness and care to others. With its origins dating back to 1910, the Harvard Prize Book award recognises promising young service leaders who have inspired others to authentic and sustainable acts of kindness.

Nivish has been commended for his contributions to the college community as well as his involvement in his neighbourhood. A proponent of active ageing, he is heavily involved in numerous events organised by his neighbourhood committee for the sake of helping the elderly in his neighbourhood live a more active lifestyle.

<img src="/images/twm11a.jpg" style="width:85%">

Within the college community, Nivish led the 47th&nbsp;Student Council as its President. In this capacity, he worked tirelessly to improve student life within the college, serving as a voice for the student body and proposing as well as implementing numerous changes to the college, all in the name of giving his fellow schoolmates the best JC experience possible.

From Nivish we see an exemplar of a&nbsp;CJC Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart, who maximises the opportunities available to do good for those around him.

### **Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart: Grace Lee, 2010**

_Grace Lee, Class of 2010_

Grace Lee, from the Class of 2010, is one of the recipients of the prestigious Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) 2022 which is awarded by the Academy of Singapore Teachers. The award recognises young teachers who demonstrate a strong passion for teaching and nurturing students.

Grace decided to embark on a teaching career as she “wanted a job that could make a positive impact on others”. She was also inspired by her mother who was also a teacher. Grace’s mother would regale her with stories of the memorable encounters she had experienced in the classroom. As they say, the apple does not fall far from the tree.

Grace’s passion for History was seeded during her time in Catholic Junior College (CJC) where she was an Arts student. She credits her History tutors—Ms&nbsp;Narindar, Ms Michelle Teo and Ms Sarah Soh—for their “patience”, and for bringing History to life with their “gripping stories and interesting lessons.” Her time in CJC was filled with rich learning experiences such as an&nbsp;Overseas Community Involvement Project (OCIP) trip to Batam where she spent three days clearing the drains and painting the house of a beneficiary with her classmates. Those experiences have left an indelible mark on her, and she still remembers them fondly today. When asked to give advice to the current batch of CJC students, she said “Life is what you make of it. Enjoy the two years of JC as they will fly by!”

As a History and Social Studies teacher, Grace aims to make her lessons relevant to her students. Many students think of History and Social Studies as boring subjects that have little to no bearing on their current lives. To disabuse students of this perception, Grace finds innovative ways to not only enliven her lessons but also to help her students make real-world connections. For example, she engages her students&nbsp;through history games and virtual tours of historical sites such as Auschwitz. Her&nbsp;students have used the skill of cross-referencing sources to verify the credibility of the information they come across on a daily basis.

“Once, my student proudly told me that he avoided an online scam by cross-checking the dubious text message that he received with online sites warning users of scams. I was glad that he could read between the lines and use his analytical skills,” Grace said.

With her dedication and clear-eyed sense of purpose to nurture her students into critical thinkers, Grace truly exemplifies the qualities of a&nbsp;_teacher_&nbsp;with a mission, leader with a heart. Her goal is “to impact lives by creating opportunities for students to try, achieve and grow.” Those are words to live by for any educator.

### **Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart: Deirdre Ng, 2020**

<img src="/images/twm9.jpg" style="width:85%">

_Deirdre on an overseas service learning trip to Chiang Mai, Thailand._ 

Self-preservation seems to have taken on a new urgency in the midst of the ongoing global pandemic. Many have retreated into themselves as a survival mechanism. However, Deirdre Ng (2T02, Class of 2020) chose to view the pandemic as the perfect opportunity to look outwards to the needs of the elderly in society.

Deirdre served as the Public Relations Director of the Interact Club when she was a student in Catholic Junior College (CJC). As part of her duties, she facilitated weekly bonding sessions with the elderly at St Luke’s ElderCare. Spending time with the elderly and communicating with them using dialect inspired her to continue helping them after she graduated from CJC. Deirdre and her fellow Interact Club members were also part of a one-week overseas service learning programme to Chiang Mai, Thailand, where they learnt more about the plight of the indigenous Karen Hill Tribe. They also helped to construct water tanks for the tribe which was a rewarding experience. Although Deirdre and her peers found communicating with the locals challenging, they chose to focus on communicating with the universal language of care and love.

<img src="/images/twm9a.jpg" style="width:85%">

Her role as an Assistant Home Tutorial Councillor (AHTC) during her time in CJC, which required her to be part of the planning committee for her home class’ local service-learning project (LSLP), further fuelled her passion for volunteerism. She was involved in planning activities for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although Deirdre was worried about how to reach out to the children, she soon realised that serving others should not be constrained by unfounded fears and myopic stereotypes. She says, “These children are just like us in every way. They are just enjoying the whimsical nature of childhood. As a society, we should try to look beyond their disability.”

After graduating from CJC, Deirdre joined the Youth Corps which mentors and empowers youths in Singapore to initiate their own community service projects. With the support of the organisation, Deirdre and her fellow Youth Corps members launched an initiative called We+65 to tackle the issue of social isolation amongst senior citizens. However, COVID-19 hit our shores, throwing a huge spanner in the works.

<img src="/images/twm9b.jpg" style="width:85%">

Due to a spike in community infections, Deirdre and her team had to pivot to launching the project online which put months of planning to waste. Furthermore, many of the senior citizens they were working with were not tech-savvy enough to use some of the video conferencing applications. Undaunted, Deirdre personally reached out to selected members of the elderly community via their landline phones. In recognition of her efforts, Deirdre was presented with a certificate by President Halimah Yacob at the&nbsp;Youth Corps Singapore Leaders Programme Commencement Ceremony 2022 held on January 22.

<img src="/images/twm9c.jpg" style="width:85%">

When asked for her definition of what makes someone a “Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart”, Deirdre mentioned that one must not only strive for academic excellence, but must also remember to step forward to uplift others as well. She added that her CJC education has taught her the importance of living In Truth and In Love.

### **Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart: Nazra Shahnaz, 2021**

<img src="/images/twm8.jpg" style="width:45%">

*Nazra Shahnaz, 2T19 - one of top five finalists of Halogen Foundation's National Young Leader Award 2021*

**_‘Be the change you want to see’_** - I especially enjoy this quote because my purpose as a leader is to embody it.

My name is Nazra Shahnaz, and I am a J2 student (2T19) from Catholic Junior College (CJC). I was nominated for the National Young Leader Award (NYLA) in March this year, and I never thought the 6-month journey would be one of the most life-changing experiences for me. It taught me how to carry myself as a leader, about the importance of communication, how to resolve a conflict in ideas and many more attributes I now hold close to my heart in being a leader.

My favourite phase of the award was the Leadership Trials. Though it was through a screen, I was able to meet many promising youth with such amazing ideas to bring to the table and this really amplified the faith I have in my peers. Through both the glory and shortfalls of my team, I was able to learn the importance of planning ahead, facilitating open communication, leveraging on the strengths of each team member to create a better outcome, and this shaped me to better prepare for the rest of my award journey and leadership opportunities to come. Meeting change-makers in a common place, finding middle ground with different inputs, and listening to the brilliant ideas everyone had helped me realise that I am not alone in my goals of creating positive change, and that leaders can better support one another through collaboration.

CJC has gifted me many leadership experiences; my teachers saw promise in me and wanted to help me develop it. My tenure as President of CJC Choir greatly shaped my leadership as navigating through the restrictions of the volatile COVID-19 situation left my team and I faced with many hurdles in planning and executing Choir sessions. Through the setbacks, we were able to learn to plan and brainstorm better and as a leader, I learnt to communicate better. I found that one of a leader’s key purposes is to exude a spirit of enthusiasm and proactivity so as to keep morale and productivity up when times were tough.

When I founded [Shareducation](https://shareducation.webador.com/), my goal was to help bridge the gap between students who had a headstart in their studies due to having access to tuition services, and those who did not have that luxury. This came from a place of understanding as I too, found myself in a similar situation growing up. But after NYLA, I realised that my cause is so much more than that. I empower others by teaching my beneficiaries to create goals and aspirations, and that no matter how big or small they may seem, they are valid. I empower my team of 30 volunteers by allowing them to make full use of all the resources available to create a bigger impact and serve the community. 

For as far as my mind can reach, NYLA, [Shareducation](https://shareducation.webador.com/), and my leadership experiences in CJC have only taught me about my true purpose: to not just be a leader, but a servant leader. To think with a mission, and lead with a heart. To have a zest for life and a generous spirit in my leadership. I see my potential to serve, and regardless of the profession I pursue in the future, I would like to serve and change more lives. My hope for the future of youth is for more of us to find it in ourselves to step forward and build more inclusive societies. I am no perfect leader, but I am grateful that NYLA saw promise in me to do this.

Above all, having the honour to be a part of something as special as NYLA sparked a period of personal growth I never knew myself and the people I work with needed — and beyond the cameras, interviews and blue pantsuits, I’m grateful for that.

### **Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart: Kim Yu Ling, 2020**

<img src="/images/twm6.jpg" style="width:85%">

Congratulations to Kim Yu Ling, Class of 2020, for receiving the Harvard Prize Book (Singapore) 2020/21 award, presented to promising students all around the world who go beyond the call of duty to show kindness and care to others. Presented since 1910, the Harvard Prize Book award recognises promising young service leaders who have inspired others to authentic and sustainable acts of kindness.

Yu Ling has been commended for pursuing her interest in healthcare as a long-term volunteer with St Luke's ElderCare and initiating a research project under the year-long InterHealth Innovators Programme from June 2019 to June 2020, in collaboration with the Centre for Innovation in Healthcare (National University Health Systems). Apart from submitting her work to conferences, Yu Ling’s data-driven inquiry culminated in her project team’s staunch advocacy for proper warm up exercises to stave off knee injuries.

While many only ever aspire to extend an active involvement in school-based programmes like Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) and the Overseas Service Learning Programme (OSLP) to external, self-sourced initiatives, Yu Ling has a track record of doing just that without expectation of any reward. Her Home Tutor experienced this first-hand when she chanced upon Yu Ling with a large bag of buns she had prepared to distribute to the migrant workers in her neighbourhood to show them that Singaporeans stand in solidarity with them during the Covid-19 pandemic.

From Yu Ling we see an exemplar of a&nbsp;CJC Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart, who maximises the opportunities available to do good. May Yu Ling’s example and the lives she has touched in CJC and beyond be a beacon to us as we navigate the new normal amongst many stricken by the pandemic.&nbsp;

### **Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart: Emma Lai Oi Yeng, Chua Ann Teng, 2021**

<img src="/images/emmalai.jpg" style="width:85%">

_Emma Lai Oi Yeng, 2T26, Class of 2021 (left), and Chua Ann Teng, 2T05, Class of 2020 (right), receiving the National Young Leader Award 2020 from Mrs Phyllis Lim._

There is a saying that leadership is the extraordinary ability to get extraordinary achievements from ordinary people. This is consistent with Catholic Junior College’s (CJC) mission of developing Thinkers with a Mission, and Leaders with a Heart**_._**&nbsp;Both Emma Lai Oi Yeng (2T26, Class of 2021), and Chua Ann Teng (2T05, Class of 2020), have exemplified the values of the college’s mission, leading to their nominations as two of Halogen Foundation’s Top 50 National Young Leader Awardees of 2020 in Singapore.

<u>Emma Lai Oi Yeng, 2T26, Class of 2021</u><br>
“Put others before yourself” was the simple axiom that inspired Emma Lai to give back to society in any way she could. This was what motivated Emma to initiate and spearhead Project EANA (Empowering All Children who Need Assistance) with her friends, Amber, Amelia, and Najaat. Project EANA considers worthy causes to support, such as a fundraising collaboration between Citi-YMCA, Youth-for-Causes, and Children's Wishing Well. The collaboration’s objectives are to assist with raising awareness about children in dysfunctional and underprivileged family situations, administer help to the underprivileged children in Singapore, and to value every child such that no child is left behind. Emma, along with her friends, raised awareness and funds for their cause by selling items like tie-dye shirts, tote bags, and bucket hats. They also managed to recruit over 30 young volunteers across Singapore who were willing to give time to design and prepare the items.

Starting such an ambitious idea proved arduous as Emma already had to deal with her studies, Project Work and the responsibilities of being CJC’s Nexus Investment and Entrepreneurship Society President. The pandemic presented different challenges owing to the lack of physical meetings. Moreover, during the circuit breaker period, certain plans faced limitations and frequent road blocks. For instance, after Phase 2 was initiated, they had to put in place safe distancing measures in the preparation of merchandise. Despite these, Emma and her team overcame the odds by being spontaneous and adaptable. Success did not come easy as all of them sacrificed their leisure and study time in order to complete their tasks within the project’s timeline.

Emma remained steadfast in her mission as she held on to the belief that the children must not be left behind or ignored. By being resilient, strong and lionhearted, Emma and her team raised over $1,000 for the project. The National Young Leader Award is an affirmation of Emma’s mission and purpose to serve others in the community. Emma would like to encourage her peers and beyond to volunteer so that people have the opportunity to grow personally, understand themselves more and discover hidden talents they have.

<u>Chua Ann Teng, (2T05, Class of 2020)</u><br>
Chua Ann Teng’s leadership journey in CJC was a colourful one as the Captain of the college’s Shooting CCA. Ann Teng was also an Orientation Group Leader as well as the Aesthetics Leader of her class. Her passion for shooting began when she was in primary school. This passion was the driving force of her leadership style in the college. She understood that not everyone who joined her CCA would share the same fervour. In this regard, she would share her love for shooting with her teammates whenever she could. As Captain of the CCA, she inspired her teammates through the tips and tricks, and technical expertise she had learnt from her many years in the sport.

Ann Teng’s vision for leadership was simple: she wanted to be the voice of her community. She valued inclusivity and strived for everyone’s ideas to be reflected. Her teammates were not regarded as followers – rather, they were her equal. She worked hard to forge an environment in which her teammates would feel comfortable and cared for. Despite the unforeseen hurdles thrown at her during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ann Teng did her best to keep spirits high in the CCA. She continued to encourage and recognise the efforts of her teammates, making them feel acknowledged and affirmed.

Her time in CJC has sculpted her into a better leader. From her three different leadership positions, she learnt important values such as resilience, care, and discipline. She also received tremendous support from her teachers - in terms of both academic and emotional support. Under the mentorship of her teachers, she acquired the vital skills of communicating effectively and listening with empathy to the concerns of her members. These lessons have positively impacted her leadership style and she looks forward to applying these in her future endeavours.

This award serves as a sign of acknowledgement and encouragement to Ann Teng; that her efforts have been recognised, for her to keep improving herself, and to continue striving in her leadership journey. Ann Teng believes that everyone can exhibit leadership simply through their small acts towards other people in their daily lives. She tells her juniors not to be afraid of stepping up, and she hopes to see more ideas by the current and upcoming cohorts of CJC’s leaders.

Ronan Siah, CJC’s 2019 Arts Valedictorian, received the Harvard Prize Book (Singapore) 2019/20 award in recognition of his altruistic spirit. A long-standing award presented since 1910, the significance of the Harvard Prize Book lies in its support for and encouragement of students with notable promise of becoming service leaders that can inspire others to authentic and sustainable acts of kindness.&nbsp;In his role as the Publicity Head of his Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), the Environmental Science Society, Ronan drove the publicity for projects that pushed for climate action in his college. Ronan frequently made speeches during assembly in order to rally the student cohort to support various environmental programmes initiated by the CCA, such as Earth Day. Ronan also assisted his CCA to collaborate with Public Utilities Board (PUB) Singapore to organize a college-wide initiative to raise awareness on water conservation issues. He represented the college in the ASEAN Plus 3 Youth Environment Forum, a programme aimed to empower youths to have greater practical resolve to implement schemes that would influence others to live green.  

Ronan’s achievement also affirms his dedication to volunteering with the Youth Corps, YMCA, SPCA, and to serving as senior trainer in the NPCC at his alma mater, ACS (Barker). Addressing the distinguished guests and his peers at the Harvard Prize Book ceremony, Ronan shared about caring for the environment, a cause he is deeply passionate about. We are proud of Ronan, whose qualities exemplify the College’s mission – every student becoming a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart – and immensely hopeful that the lives he has touched in CJC will galvanise others to extend the culture of care beyond CJC, to our wider community.

### **Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart: Lee Chao Rui, 2019**

<img src="/images/leechaorui.jpeg" style="width:85%">

Volunteering is a noble act that anyone can do and it opens our eyes to the different lifestyles others lead. It is about wanting to give back to the society that you have received a lot from. Not only can we gain an insight into the lives people lead, we can also put a smile on their faces, knowing that we may have made their day. That is a priceless sense of gratitude and satisfaction that we can receive from volunteering.&nbsp;

Lee Chao Rui from 2T24 is one of those who have found their call in volunteering. Chao Rui has been involved in the community since 2011, when he was only 10 years old. To date, he has facilitated closed door dialogues for groups, conducted house visits, and even initiated and organised a talk for 200 residents on eye care and hearing loss delivered by four senior renowned specialists. From a tender age, Chao Rui demonstrated a clarity of purpose quite unexpected from someone so young - to return the blessings the community had given him and to pay it forward.&nbsp;

Chao Rui truly embodies our school motto, ‘In Veritate Et Caritate’ - In truth and love. He is someone who is driven by the desire to serve and improve the world around them. Even under the heavy burden of his school work, he has never wavered in his commitment to give and continued his volunteer work even during his major school examinations.&nbsp;For example, during 2017-2019, he contributed to Changi General Hospital in several ways. He played the piano in the Changi General Hospital Atrium for its patients, staff and caregivers on a regular basis, providing music therapy to reduce stress and to help them relax. In addition to that, Chao Rui also worked with the hospital’s Regional Health &amp; Continuity Care department to plan and facilitate health screening for temple devotees who would otherwise not go for regular health check-ups.&nbsp;

Not only does he do volunteer work in his free time, Chao Rui is also outstanding in his co-curricular activity. As the President of the College’s Interact Club, he was instrumental in the planning and successful implementation of the club’s Overseas Service Learning Project (OSLP) to Bintan, where he led his team to build a sewage and waste water treatment system in a village, immensely improving the living conditions of the villagers. The team also gave English lessons to the village’s school children. The project won the Best Interact Club Project in Singapore Region (Gold Award) from the Rotary Club of Singapore. Chao Rui’s compassion towards others and a strong sense of community spirit was also evident in his active participation in the planning and execution of his class' Service Learning Project - the Seniors Buddy Day Programme, in collaboration with Calvary Community Care. One of the Project’s aims was to promote greater social interactions and forge closer friendship and neighbourliness among the elderly from the Potong Pasir Constituency by engaging and supporting them in craft-making activities and games. They even planned for and coordinated a full-day outing at Singapore Zoological Gardens for the elderly.&nbsp;

Chao Rui’s care for the community went beyond the scope of his duties and responsibilities as the President of the Interact Club in CJ. This was strongly demonstrated by his active involvement outside school where he volunteered to lead a community project. As the Principal Investigator for the Singapore (SG) Bicentennial Project, Chao Rui had to research the values, beliefs and aspirations of the Teochews in the community by engaging residents staying in the Bedok Reservoir Estate. To generate further publicity about the Teochews among non-residents, Chao Rui also completed an e-book that showcased the exhibition videos and other artefacts accessed during the project. Chao Rui always believes in the value of service for others, and the project provided ample opportunities for personal growth and reflection on the possible ways he can contribute to the community in future.&nbsp;

It could not have been easy - balancing a social life, the stress of junior college, his scouting co-curricular activity and his mission to serve others, yet he pulls through time and again, doing all he can to ensure that he keeps a balanced keel on his studies and volunteering activities.&nbsp;

Volunteering has played a vital role in shaping Chao Rui to the person he is today. In fact, he has become a role model for other youths. CJC provides opportunities for their students to develop themselves into a “Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart” and Lee Chao Rui is a living testament. The humility of volunteering moves one to be less selfish and more selfless. With a passion for helping others, we hope to see more CJCians reaching out to the community in order to ensure that no one gets left behind in our society.&nbsp;

### **Youth Community Leadership Award 2019 - Ng Yee Lin, 2T22**
<img src="/images/ngyeelin.jpg" style="width:65%">

*Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Dr Koh Poh Koon, presents the Youth Community Leadership Award to Ng Yee Lin.*


There are not enough words in the dictionary to describe the significance of giving back. Even the simplest acts of kindness can go a long way in changing someone’s life. It creates close-knit relationships between strangers. There are many ways one can give back to the society. Through volunteering, people gain eye-opening experiences by helping others in need. In Singapore, schools widely encourage students to participate in community service to learn life skills and attain knowledge.

Ng Yee Lin of 2T22, who received a Youth Community Leadership Award exemplifies this. The award was given by the Yio Chu Kang Community Club for her heart for service. Yee Lin has been constantly involved in the community around her, from giving free tuition to the less fortunate, to helping out villagers in an Overseas Service Learning Programme in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Through all this, she stays humble; even during the interview with the College newsletter, she never once boasted about her achievements, saying instead how she felt undeserving as she felt she was just doing her job in helping society.

In all that Yee Lin does, she is a living ideal of the college motto, Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart (TMLH). During the interview, she constantly emphasizes how this motto drives her conviction that we should keep our goals in mind while serving others genuinely with care and empathy. She feels one does not have to be a leader in order to help or serve others, having instead the courage to take a step out of our comfort zones so as to be willing to lend a helping hand to others.

However, she faces setbacks such as her fear of meeting new people. Volunteering often requires one to talk to new partners and work with other volunteers. For instance, Yee Lin was the Youth Coordinator for one of Youth Corps’ events. Despite being the youngest Youth Coordinator, she still had to give instructions to adults who were the Volunteer Befrienders. This was indeed a challenge, but Yee Lin persevered and managed to execute it smoothly with her partners. This perseverance would not be possible without the strong love and dedication she has for community work and in fact, Yee Lin has indicated that she would like to continue doing so in the future, pursuing the life of a social worker so as to continue to help the less fortunate and play her part in society.

Indeed, giving back to society has a huge significance in this world and every individual should help one another to make this world a better place. CJC definitely provides students with opportunities to help others and take part in community involvement programmes. Yee Lin is a living testament to the ideal “Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart”. We should respect someone like her and we need more people like her as she believes that it is important to contribute to society despite the rigour of JC life. She makes time to help others despite her own struggles. Helping others replaces the selfishness in our lives with selflessness.&nbsp;Giving back to society reminds people that they are not alone and helping one another is fundamental in connecting us all as part of the fabric of humanity.
