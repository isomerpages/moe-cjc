### **CJC Houses**

#### **Unite to Ignite**
The House system is a historic feature in Catholic Junior College, with the houses initially named after the saints Patrick, Joseph, Michael, Albert, John and Gregory.  
  
These six houses would be a symbol of the college's treasured legacy, giving students a balanced life in the college, a sense of belonging and camaraderie in competition. The Houses participate in a wide range of activities and competitions, both physical and non-physical:  
  
*   College Cross Country
*   College Sports Carnival
*   Inter-House NAPFA Competition
*   Post-Exam Inter-House Games
*   Subject-based competitions
*   Talent competitions (e.g. Sing-off, Dance-off)
*   Academic achievements
*   Behaviour and discipline

#### **Four Houses, One CJC**

Reintroduced in 2012, the House system would maintain four existing names, taking on the colours of the college:&nbsp;**Albert (Yellow), Michael (Orange), Patrick (Red) and Joseph (Green)**. These names were chosen because they reflect our treasured legacy, taking on the names of our founders and principals. Each House is headed by a PE teacher as House Master / Mistress and led by a committee of JC2 students: a House Captain, Vice-House Captain, a House Secretary, a House Games Representative, House JC1 Level Representatives and various Sports Leaders.

Our four houses are proud to have the leadership and service of the following House Captains and Vice-House Captains for their respective years:

| | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert |  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick |
