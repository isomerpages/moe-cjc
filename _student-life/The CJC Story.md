In class, Kiven would go the extra mile to understand the concepts that were presented in class. Kiven also strove towards intellectual development and enjoyed engaging with abstract ideas. Furthermore, his focus on improving the environment around him and the relationships between different groups of people, by uniting them through a common purpose propelled him to engage the student body to craft the College Theme for 2018. Together with other student leaders, Kiven sought to understand both the needs of the bigger student body and the School Leaders to make concrete plans to improve the overall college experience, uniting the entire college body in the process.

He readily extends his understanding of service to the less privileged in society, and is moved by what he hears and sees, eager to translate that into socially responsible action. Kiven’s humility and earnest nature, together with his ability to lead effectively, is what endears him to his peers and in effect, everybody around him His outgoing nature is attenuated by his true strength which lies in connecting with others at their level, understanding the world from their eyes, especially their hopes and their fears.
