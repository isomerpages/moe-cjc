<h3><strong>Our Vision</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p><strong>CJC - a place of excellence in learning and living.</strong>
</p>
<p>Brother Patrick Loh, the founding principal of Catholic Junior College,
envisioned that "underlying education is the concept of the unique, irreplaceable
value of every human person. Our education should therefore help each person
to understand himself as he truly is, to fulfill their special vocation
in life."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years CJC continues to bring this vision to life, as a place
of excellence in learning and living. As an educational institution, CJC
strives for high standards in educating young people thereby enabling students
to realise their potential academically, physically and spiritually so
that our students are formed to be well-integrated into society<em>.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Student Outcomes: Every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart</strong>
</p>
<p>At CJC, we nurture every student to become a purposeful, disciplined learner
guided by strong values like humility, courage, and integrity. Our students
grow into critical and adaptive thinkers and effective communicators, striving
for veracity and justice when forming meaningful collaborations. They are
also servant leaders, ready to serve others and make a positive impact
in their communities.</p>
<p><strong>2. Staff Outcomes: Our staff nurture the holistic development of students and embody the values of being Reflective, Innovative, Caring, and Engaged, striving always for excellence.</strong>
</p>
<p>Our team of dedicated staff support the academic, physical, and spiritual
growth of every student. Our staff embody servant leadership, continuous
learning, and collaboration to create a vibrant, caring community focussed
on developing student agency.</p>
<p><strong>3. Culture Outcomes: A college culture grounded in Truth and Love — expressed through Respect, Solidarity, Service, and Excellence</strong>
</p>
<p>We envision a college culture deeply grounded in the values of truth and
love, where respect, solidarity, service, and excellence flourish. We inspire
everyone to honour their God-given dignity and unique gifts, grow in character,
and pursue their calling with passion — building a compassionate community
that contributes meaningfully to the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Building a Generation In Truth &amp; Love: Every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.</strong>
<br>We cultivate in each young person the skills and attitude to embrace challenges
wisely and courageously. We foster a community that cares for the dignity
of the young people, nurturing them to be men and women of compassion.
We broaden their vision so that they become leaders committed to serving
in faith and with integrity.</p>

</ul>
<p>Every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission, a Leader with a Heart</p>
<h4><strong>Values</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Truth and Love</strong>
<br>This means our concern for man inspires us to search for the truth. Putting
it in another way, we pursue knowledge for the service of others.</p>
<p><strong>Truth</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Intellectual dimension- Pursuing the Truth in deepening understanding
in the different disciplines of knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral dimension- Deepening our understanding of Divine Truth and living
lives that are governed by moral guidelines for the common good for all
creation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Love</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Communal - Exercising love that is accountable, that cares, nurtures and
sacrifices; a love for the common good of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual- Exercising the choice to be disciplined in body, mind and
spirit as an expression of love of oneself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To describe the desired student outcomes in simple and easily remembered
terms for the community, the phrase Thinker with a Mission, Leader with
a Heart was coined. This phrase is strongly supported and endorsed by the
Board and the alumni.</p>
<h4><strong>Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart</strong></h4>
<p>All CJCians are leaders: that all CJCians are capable of exercising self-leadership
in their daily actions and choices as individuals with or without official
leadership appointments. Here, our students are given opportunities to
apply leadership skills at the team, organisational and global levels to
serve the greater good and to become a Thinker with a Mission, a Leader
with a Heart.</p>
<p><strong>Thinker with a Mission</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This thinker pursues knowledge with a sense of purpose and searches for
Truth in the disciplines of study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This individual demonstrates and upholds the intellectual traits and values
of Humility, Courage, Empathy, Integrity, Perseverance, Faith in Reason
and Fair-mindedness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This self-directed student always questions assumptions, makes thinking

reflective thinking second nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This student thinker strives for accuracy, relevance, depth, breadth,
logic and fairness when interacting and doing assigned tasks in the classroom,
as well as when the student participates in the college’s SD, Leadership
and Co-curricular Programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Leader with a Heart</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This is a servant leader who discerns, appreciates and empathises fully
with the issues of the different members and sectors of society.</p>
</li>

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The college believes that all CJCians are leaders. Regardless of whether
they have an official appointment or not, they are capable of exercising
self-leadership in their daily actions. They will also be given opportunities
to apply leadership skills at the team, organisational and global levels
to serve the greater good.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart is a servant leader
who, as a critical-thinker, pursues knowledge with a sense of purpose,
searches for Truth in the disciplines of study, discerns, appreciates and
empathises fully with the needs and concerns of the different members and
