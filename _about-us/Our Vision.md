<h3><strong>Our Vision</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p><strong>CJC - a place of excellence in learning and living.</strong>
</p>
<p>Brother Patrick Loh, the founding principal of Catholic Junior College,
envisioned that "underlying education is the concept of the unique, irreplaceable
value of every human person. Our education should therefore help each person
to understand himself as he truly is, to fulfill their special vocation
in life."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years CJC continues to bring this vision to life, as a place
of excellence in learning and living. As an educational institution, CJC
strives for high standards in educating young people thereby enabling students
to realise their potential academically, physically and spiritually so
that our students are formed to be well-integrated into society<em>.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Student Outcomes: Every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart</strong>
</p>
<p>At CJC, we nurture every student to become a purposeful, disciplined learner
guided by strong values like humility, courage, and integrity. Our students
grow into critical and adaptive thinkers and effective communicators, striving
for veracity and justice when forming meaningful collaborations. They are
also servant leaders, ready to serve others and make a positive impact
in their communities.</p>
<p><strong>2. Staff Outcomes: Our staff nurture the holistic development of students and embody the values of being Reflective, Innovative, Caring, and Engaged, striving always for excellence.</strong>
</p>
<p>Our team of dedicated staff support the academic, physical, and spiritual
growth of every student. Our staff embody servant leadership, continuous
learning, and collaboration to create a vibrant, caring community focussed
on developing student agency.</p>
<p><strong>3. Culture Outcomes: A college culture grounded in Truth and Love — expressed through Respect, Solidarity, Service, and Excellence</strong>
</p>
<p>We envision a college culture deeply grounded in the values of truth and
love, where respect, solidarity, service, and excellence flourish. We inspire
everyone to honour their God-given dignity and unique gifts, grow in character,
and pursue their calling with passion — building a compassionate community
that contributes meaningfully to the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Building a Generation In Truth &amp; Love: Every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.</strong>
<br>At Catholic Junior College, our mission reflects our commitment to nurturing
young men and women holistically. Rooted in the Catholic tradition, this
mission calls every CJCian to pursue the truth and embody love in their
every action. It is grounded in five foundational marks:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Holistic Education</strong>- We guide students beyond academic
excellence, it develops the whole person to fulfil their unique purpose
in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human Dignity</strong>- We value the dignity of every person,
nurturing each individual to their fullest potential and fostering respect
for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Common Good</strong>- We exhort students to connect knowledge
with values and pursue truth for the common good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solidarity</strong>- We seek to cultivate relationships grounded
in trust, respect, and a common purpose, nurturing a spirit of solidarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Servant Leadership</strong>- We reflect servant leadership by
living out values of humility, compassion, and love.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Values</strong></h4>
<p>At CJC, our mission is deeply rooted in the universal values of truth
and love, which are inspired by the life of Christ.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Truth</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Intellectual dimension- Pursuing the Truth in deepening understanding
in the different disciplines of knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral dimension- Deepening our understanding of the Divine Truth and living
lives that are governed by moral guidelines such as the Dignity of the
Human Person, the Common Good, the Principle of Solidarity and the Universal
Destination of Goods and Subsidiarity.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Love</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Communal - Exercising love that is accountable, that cares, nurtures and
sacrifices; a love for the common good of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual- Exercising the choice to be disciplined in body, mind and
spirit as an expression of love of oneself.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Truth and Love: Complementary in Action&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Truth and love are inseparable and must be lived together. Truth guides
us in understanding who we are and what we are called to do, while love
animates us in ways that honour that truth. "Speaking the truth in love,
we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of Him who is the
head, that is, Christ" (Ephesians 4:15).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without truth, love becomes misguided. Without love, truth becomes cold
and impersonal. Together, they form the foundation for a life that is not
only intellectually sound but also morally and spiritually whole. This
integration of truth and love is the core of our mission at CJC.&nbsp;</p>
