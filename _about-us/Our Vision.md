<h4><strong>Values</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Truth and Love</strong>
<br>This means our concern for man inspires us to search for the truth. Putting
it in another way, we pursue knowledge for the service of others.</p>
<p><strong>Truth</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Intellectual dimension- Pursuing the Truth in deepening understanding
in the different disciplines of knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral dimension- Deepening our understanding of Divine Truth and living
lives that are governed by moral guidelines for the common good for all
creation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Love</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Communal - Exercising love that is accountable, that cares, nurtures and
sacrifices; a love for the common good of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual- Exercising the choice to be disciplined in body, mind and
spirit as an expression of love of oneself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To describe the desired student outcomes in simple and easily remembered
terms for the community, the phrase Thinker with a Mission, Leader with
a Heart was coined. This phrase is strongly supported and endorsed by the
Board and the alumni.</p>
<h4><strong>Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart</strong></h4>
<p>All CJCians are leaders: that all CJCians are capable of exercising self-leadership
in their daily actions and choices as individuals with or without official
leadership appointments. Here, our students are given opportunities to
apply leadership skills at the team, organisational and global levels to
serve the greater good and to become a Thinker with a Mission, a Leader
with a Heart.</p>
<p><strong>Thinker with a Mission</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This thinker pursues knowledge with a sense of purpose and searches for
Truth in the disciplines of study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This individual demonstrates and upholds the intellectual traits and values
of Humility, Courage, Empathy, Integrity, Perseverance, Faith in Reason
and Fair-mindedness.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>This student thinker strives for accuracy, relevance, depth, breadth,
logic and fairness when interacting and doing assigned tasks in the classroom,
as well as when the student participates in the collegeâ€™s SD, Leadership

</ul>
<p><strong>Leader with a Heart</strong>

they have an official appointment or not, they are capable of exercising
self-leadership in their daily actions. They will also be given opportunities
