### **Identity Guidelines**
Catholic Junior College is a pre-university institution that develops students holistically based on the broad Catholic principles of Truth and Love. We are committed to creating a values-driven environment that balances between academic, character and spiritual development. 

To communicate the college's values and ethos, a unified approach to communication, including a set of verbal and visual identity devices is necessary. This page provides an overview of our brand platform and its features.
