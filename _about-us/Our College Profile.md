#### **Overview**
Catholic Junior College (CJC) is a co-educational government-aided school for post- secondary education at pre-university level. Students are admitted to the school through the national Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) which takes place in January each year. Students are admitted to CJC based on the cumulative points achieved at the national GCE O-Level Examination. The basis of admission is selective based on merit.

At the end of the two years, students sit for the GCE A-Level examination. Thereafter, students who graduate from the college will go on to attend reputable universities both locally and abroad.

Each year, CJC sees a graduating cohort of about 700 to 750 students, and is recognised as a distinctive college with high levels of achievement and a place of excellence in learning and living.


#### **History**
CJC was founded in 1971 on the idea that a junior college should be established to provide holistic pre-university education for all Catholic secondary schools in Singapore. With the backing of German Bishops and local philanthropists, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore worked with the Singapore government to bring the idea to fruition, leading to the laying of CJC’s foundation stone in 1974 by the then Education Minister, Dr. Lee Chiaw Meng.

CJC began accepting students in 1975 and was officially opened in June 1976 by Mr. E.W. Barker, then the Minister of Law and the Environment. Today, we stand as Singapore’s third oldest Junior College and continue to develop students holistically as ‘Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart’ in a changing global landscape.

#### **Vision**
**CJC -&nbsp;A&nbsp;Place of&nbsp;Excellence&nbsp;in&nbsp;Learning&nbsp;and&nbsp;Living.**
* Excellence - Striving for high standards in educating young people.

#### **The Singapore-Cambridge A-Level (Advanced Level) Examination Syllabus (revised in 2007)**
From&nbsp;2006,&nbsp;a&nbsp;broader&nbsp;and&nbsp;more&nbsp;flexible&nbsp;A-Level&nbsp;curriculum&nbsp;was&nbsp;adopted&nbsp;in&nbsp;line&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation’s&nbsp;approach&nbsp;for&nbsp;formal&nbsp;education&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;to&nbsp;changing&nbsp;needs&nbsp;both&nbsp;locally&nbsp;and&nbsp;globally.

&nbsp;All&nbsp;students&nbsp;taking&nbsp;the&nbsp;GCE&nbsp;A-Level&nbsp;examinations&nbsp;should&nbsp;be&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;study&nbsp;a&nbsp;contrasting&nbsp;subject&nbsp;(from&nbsp;a&nbsp;discipline&nbsp;other&nbsp;than&nbsp;their&nbsp;main&nbsp;course&nbsp;of&nbsp;study),&nbsp;as&nbsp;well&nbsp;as&nbsp;to&nbsp;engage&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;project-based&nbsp;activity&nbsp;with&nbsp;their&nbsp;peers.&nbsp;A&nbsp;new&nbsp;three-tiered&nbsp;structure&nbsp;was&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;with&nbsp;H1,&nbsp;H2&nbsp;and&nbsp;H3&nbsp;options&nbsp;available&nbsp;–&nbsp;categories&nbsp;sorted&nbsp;by&nbsp;increasing&nbsp;rigour&nbsp;demanded.

All&nbsp;students&nbsp;are&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;take&nbsp;a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;of&nbsp;three&nbsp;subjects&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;H2&nbsp;level&nbsp;and&nbsp;these&nbsp;are&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;full&nbsp;A-Level&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;current&nbsp;UK&nbsp;system.&nbsp;In&nbsp;addition,&nbsp;students&nbsp;must&nbsp;sit&nbsp;for&nbsp;one&nbsp;other&nbsp;subject&nbsp;at&nbsp;either&nbsp;H1&nbsp;or&nbsp;H2&nbsp;level.

There&nbsp;are&nbsp;two&nbsp;compulsory&nbsp;elements&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;two-year&nbsp;course&nbsp;which&nbsp;are&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to&nbsp;as&nbsp;**“Knowledge**&nbsp;**Skills”** subjects&nbsp;(see&nbsp;below).&nbsp;These&nbsp;are&nbsp;General&nbsp;Paper,&nbsp;Knowledge&nbsp;and&nbsp;Inquiry&nbsp;and Project&nbsp;Work&nbsp;(completed&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;year).

Students&nbsp;are&nbsp;expected&nbsp;to&nbsp;take&nbsp;a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;of&nbsp;10&nbsp;units&nbsp;(H1:&nbsp;1&nbsp;unit;&nbsp;H2:&nbsp;2&nbsp;units;&nbsp;H3:&nbsp;1&nbsp;unit).&nbsp;Some&nbsp;students&nbsp;may&nbsp;take&nbsp;a&nbsp;more&nbsp;demanding&nbsp;course&nbsp;of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;12&nbsp;units.&nbsp;These&nbsp;students&nbsp;would&nbsp;most&nbsp;likely&nbsp;take&nbsp;a&nbsp;fourth H2&nbsp;subject&nbsp;and&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;a&nbsp;subject&nbsp;at&nbsp;the H3&nbsp;level.

#### **Academic Calendar**
The&nbsp;academic&nbsp;year&nbsp;runs&nbsp;from&nbsp;January&nbsp;to&nbsp;December,&nbsp;comprising&nbsp;two&nbsp;semesters&nbsp;or&nbsp;four&nbsp;terms.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;course&nbsp;of&nbsp;study&nbsp;typically&nbsp;lasts&nbsp;for&nbsp;two&nbsp;years&nbsp;and&nbsp;culminates&nbsp;in&nbsp;students&nbsp;taking&nbsp;the&nbsp;GCE A-Level&nbsp;examinations&nbsp;in&nbsp;November&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;graduating&nbsp;year.

Internal&nbsp;examinations&nbsp;are&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;across&nbsp;two&nbsp;years&nbsp;so&nbsp;that&nbsp;students&nbsp;and&nbsp;staff&nbsp;can&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;progress&nbsp;in&nbsp;learning:
* JC1 (year 11): Mid-Year Examination, Promotional Examination
* JC2 (year 12): Mid-Year Examination, Preliminary Examination

Estimated&nbsp;or&nbsp;predicted&nbsp;grades&nbsp;are&nbsp;based&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;student’s&nbsp;progress&nbsp;across&nbsp;the&nbsp;two&nbsp;years&nbsp;and&nbsp;are&nbsp;sent&nbsp;to&nbsp;universities&nbsp;and&nbsp;college&nbsp;admissions&nbsp;boards&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;GCE&nbsp;A-Level&nbsp;examination&nbsp;results&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;yet&nbsp;available,&nbsp;due&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;differences&nbsp;in&nbsp;college/&nbsp;academic&nbsp;calendars.

#### **Classes and Course Load**
Based on the minimum 10 unit course, classes for each subject are taught through lectures, tutorial sessions and for science subjects, practical sessions. Each class period lasts for 55 minutes, with practical sessions utilising two such periods. In addition to the lecture/tutorial approach, certain classes are conducted using a seminar approach for greater levels of inquiry and interaction. This mode of delivery has been adopted for all Humanities subjects from 2016.

Some students with the interest and aptitude to offer subjects at a higher level are able to offer 1 to 2 H2 subjects at the H3 level. H3 courses are conducted in a variety of ways, depending on each discipline, in collaboration with Institutes of Higher Learning. They are equivalent to the American high school honours courses or the S papers in the UK system. The other common mode of assessment for H3 courses would be through an extended research essay where the research is carried out independently by the student.

#### **Grading system at CJC**
<center>A-Level Grading<br>Grades A-E are considered passing grades whilst grade S Is considered a ‘sub- pass’ - falling below expectation. Grade U (ungraded) is considered a failing grade. The marking divisions are shown below.</center>

#### **The CJC Ignite Programme**
The CJC Ignite programme is a talent development programme in alignment to the College’s mission of “Building a generation: In Truth &amp; Love” where every CJCian is a Thinker with a Mission and a Leader with a Heart. Our integrated curriculum prepares students to be critical thinkers and future-oriented leaders, through providing them with the opportunities to ask difficult questions, uncover core theories and analyse complex problems. Students from the Ignite Programme not only achieve excellent results in the GCE A-Level examination, they are also recognised for their holistic leadership qualities.

The CJC Ignite programme is built upon the following principles:
* Seminar-style pedagogy, encouraging exploration, reflection and expression of ideas
* Smaller teacher-student ratio, allowing for greater tutor-student interaction and engagement
* An authentic service learning project for a target community and / or advocacy programme
* A residential programme at NUS U-Town based on our integrated learning approach Integration of subject disciplines, through a concept-based approach
* Greater opportunities to develop life skills, communication and leadership skills

#### **Knowledge Skills**
These subjects are designed to support a rigorous course of academic study by developing higher order thinking skills, conceptual thinking, processing skills and communication skills.

General Paper – This subject develops in students the ability to think critically, explore a range of key issues of global and local significance and express their views in cogent arguments using accurate and effective language. It comprises two main modes of assessment (writing and reading comprehension) to ensure that students are familiar with the skills required to write an academic argument and to evaluate and assess academic writing. The course spans the complete two years of the junior college course.

Project Work – Students work in groups of 4-5 on a research task set at the national level. This results in a written report, a group project file, and an oral presentation of their research findings and recommendations. All aspects of Project Work are assessed in the first year (JC1).

#### **Ministry of Education (MOE) Special Programmes at CJC**
**English Language and Linguistics**<br>
English Language and Linguistics (ELL) is a subject offered at the H2 level. This subject has been offered as a national A-Level curriculum since 2009. ELL provides students with an excellent grounding in the intricacies of the English language and includes features of disciplines such as Linguistics, Psycholinguistics and Sociolinguistics.

CJC is one of the three schools offering the English Language Elective Programme (ELEP) in Singapore. This allows selected students with high aptitude for the subject to receive bond-free scholarships that include remission of school fees and an annual allowance.

#### **Local and Overseas Academic Learning Programme and Trips**
CJC offers students a rich learning programme which enables engaged and authentic learning experiences. Besides classroom learning, students embark on a range of exciting learning activities, competitions, talent development and research programmes. These also include overseas academic trips to the UK, Hong Kong and India in partnership with reputable organisations and Institutes of Higher Learning such as REACH Cambridge, Hong Kong University (HKU) and the Singapore Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry (MTI).

Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges faced by our students and their families, the College has decided that the donations received under our “CJ45 celebrations in 2020” will be used to support students who require financial assistance. The original aim of the CJ45 fundraising project, that is, to renovate the CJC hostel to develop a student learning hub, has been cancelled due to escalating construction costs which has rendered the project unfeasible.  
  
The College has informed all donors of the change in usage of donations. This message is to inform the remaining donors who are uncontactable. Donors with further queries may contact the College at (65) 62524083 and&nbsp;[catholic\_jc@moe.edu.sg](mailto:catholic_jc@moe.edu.sg)
