#### **Overview**
Catholic Junior College (CJC) is a co-educational government-aided school for post- secondary education at pre-university level. Students are admitted to the school through the national Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) which takes place in January each year. Students are admitted to CJC based on the cumulative points achieved at the national GCE O-Level Examination. The basis of admission is selective based on merit.

At the end of the two years, students sit for the GCE A-Level examination. Thereafter, students who graduate from the college will go on to attend reputable universities both locally and abroad.

Each year, CJC sees a graduating cohort of about 700 to 750 students, and is recognised as a distinctive college with high levels of achievement and a place of excellence in learning and living.

#### **History**
CJC was founded in 1971 on the idea that a junior college should be established to provide holistic pre-university education for all Catholic secondary schools in Singapore. With the backing of German Bishops and local philanthropists, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore worked with the Singapore government to bring the idea to fruition, leading to the laying of CJC’s foundation stone in 1974 by the then Education Minister, Dr. Lee Chiaw Meng.

CJC began accepting students in 1975 and was officially opened in June 1976 by Mr. E.W. Barker, then the Minister of Law and the Environment. Today, we stand as Singapore’s third oldest Junior College and continue to develop students holistically as ‘Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart’ in a changing global landscape.

#### **Vision**
**CJC - A Place of Excellence in Learning and Living.**

* Excellence - Striving for high standards in educating young people.
* Learning - Enabling students to realise their potential academically, physically and spiritually.
* Living - Forming a person who is well-integrated into society.

#### **Mission**
**Building a Generation in Truth and Love: Every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission and a Leader with a Heart.**

We cultivate in each CJCian the skills and attitude to embrace challenges wisely and courageously. We foster a community that cares for the dignity of these young people, nurturing them to be men and women of compassion. We broaden their vision so that they become leaders committed to serving in faith and with integrity.

#### **Values**
**Truth and Love**<br>
In CJC we pursue knowledge for the service of others.

**Truth**
* Intellectual dimension - Pursuing the Truth in deepening understanding in the different disciplines of knowledge.
* Moral dimension - Deepening our understanding of Divine Truth and living lives that are governed by moral guidelines for the Common Good for all creation.

**Love**
* Communal - Exercising love that is accountable, that cares, nurtures and sacrifices; a love for the common good of all.
* Individual - Exercising the choice to be disciplined in body, mind and spirit as an expression of love of oneself.

#### **Student Outcomes: Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart**
The school’s mission is to develop every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission, and Leader with a Heart - a servant leader who, as a critical-thinker, pursues knowledge with a sense of purpose, searches for Truth in the disciplines of study, discerns, appreciates and empathises fully with the needs and concerns of the different members and sectors of society.

#### **Thinker with a Mission**
* This thinker pursues knowledge with a sense of purpose and searches for Truth in the disciplines of study.
* This individual demonstrates and upholds the intellectual traits and values of Humility, Courage, Empathy, Integrity, Perseverance, Faith in Reason and Fair- mindedness.
* This self-directed student always questions assumptions, makes thinking visible, displays conceptual understanding, generates new ideas and makes reflective thinking second nature.
* This student thinker strives for accuracy, relevance, depth, breadth, logic and

fairness when interacting and doing assigned tasks in the classroom, as well as when the student participates in the college’s Student Development,

Leadership and Co-curricular Programmes.

#### **Leader with a Heart**
* This is a servant leader who discerns, appreciates and empathises fully with the issues of the different members and sectors of society.
* This servant leader demonstrates the seven attributes of Integrity, Discernment, Resilience, Purpose, Nurturing, Initiative and Humility.
* This individual internalises the learning and understanding into a powerful motivation and drive to lead, advocate and serve the cause of the needy and the disadvantaged.
* The college believes that all CJCians are leaders. Regardless of whether they have an official appointment or not, they are capable of exercising self- leadership in their daily actions. They will also be given opportunities to apply leadership skills at the team, organisational and global levels to serve the greater good.

#### **Key Student Development Programmes**
CJC’s Student Development programme is based on enacting social change, starting from the SELF, learning to work and inspire a TEAM towards the benefit of the larger COMMUNITY. Every students is required to take ownership in developing his or her leadership potential, with a focus on translating core leadership principles to serve others and enact positive change both locally and overseas.

#### **Local Leadership Programmes:**
**(a)  Local Service Learning Programme (LSLP)**<br>
Every year, all JC1 students initiate and implement a local Service Learning project. The aim is to develop in each CJCian a sense of mission, a compassionate heart and a commitment to serve others. Each JC1 class is given the autonomy to identify a voluntary welfare association to partner and champion a cause they would like to advocate for. Our students partner about 25 Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), impacting various sectors of the community such as the elderly, low income families, disadvantaged children, people with special needs and migrant workers. Facilitated by their Home Tutors, students reach out to the beneficiaries in order to understand the issues involved. Employing the use of the reflective cycle, students connect their head knowledge with their ‘hearts’ and eventually translate it into action to benefit their community.

**(b) Work Attachment and Shadowing Programme (WASP)**<br>
The CJC WASP aims to help students’ transition from school to further education and work. It enables students to apply their knowledge, skills and values in different work context, thus improving their capacity to manage their educational and career pathways. Based on WASP, students spend two to three weeks on a work attachment whereby they come to see the importance of their future university and career choices and are inspired to make a positive difference. They are also guided through a deliberate process of reflections, which is further supplemented by lessons that help them to see their role in Singapore’s future, and how their actions have a wider impact on others.

#### **Global Leadership Programmes**
**Overseas Service Learning Programmes (OSLP)**<br>
A signature global leadership development programme which enables JC1 students to participate in overseas Service Learning trips to countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia, where they engage and serve local communities. The programme weaves reflective practice, peer learning, decision- making processes, exploration and investigation to complement the college's mission, building a generation of students with the mission to lead and serve others and make a positive impact beyond Singapore

#### **The Singapore-Cambridge A-Level (Advanced Level) Examination Syllabus (revised in 2007)**
From 2006, a broader and more flexible A-Level curriculum was adopted in line with the nation’s approach for formal education to be relevant to changing needs both locally and globally.

All students taking the GCE A-Level examinations should be required to study a contrasting subject (from a discipline other than their main course of study), as well as to engage in a project-based activity with their peers. A new three-tiered structure was introduced with H1, H2 and H3 options available – categories sorted by increasing rigour demanded.

All students are required to take a minimum of three subjects at the H2 level and these are equivalent to a full A-Level in the current UK system. In addition, students must sit for one other subject at either H1 or H2 level.

There are two compulsory elements of the two-year course which are referred to as “Knowledge Skills” subjects (see below). These are General Paper, Knowledge and Inquiry and Project Work (completed in the first year).

Students are expected to take a minimum of 10 units (H1: 1 unit; H2: 2 units; H3: 1 unit). Some students may take a more demanding course of up to 12 units. These students would most likely take a fourth H2 subject and possibly a subject at the H3 level.

#### **Academic Calendar**
The academic year runs from January to December, comprising two semesters or four terms. Each course of study typically lasts for two years and culminates in students taking the GCE A-Level examinations in November of the graduating year.

Internal examinations are conducted across two years so that students and staff can monitor progress in learning:

* JC1 (year 11): Promotional Examination
* JC2 (year 12): Mid-Year Examination, Preliminary Examination

Estimated or predicted grades are based on the student’s progress across the two years and are sent to universities and college admissions boards if the GCE A-Level examination results are not yet available, due to the differences in college/ academic calendars.

#### **Classes and Course Load**
Based on the minimum 10 unit course, classes for each subject are taught through lectures, tutorial sessions and for science subjects, practical sessions. Each class period lasts for 55 minutes, with practical sessions utilising two such periods. In addition to the lecture/tutorial approach, certain classes are conducted using a seminar approach for greater levels of inquiry and interaction. This mode of delivery has been adopted for all Humanities subjects from 2016.

Some students with the interest and aptitude to offer subjects at a higher level are able to offer 1 to 2 H2 subjects at the H3 level. H3 courses are conducted in a variety of ways, depending on each discipline, in collaboration with Institutes of Higher Learning. They are equivalent to the American high school honours courses or the S papers in the UK system. The other common mode of assessment for H3 courses would be through an extended research essay where the research is carried out independently by the student.

#### **Grading system at CJC**
<center>A-Level Grading<br>Grades A-E are considered passing grades whilst grade S Is considered a ‘sub- pass’ - falling below expectation. Grade U (ungraded) is considered a failing grade. The marking divisions are shown below.</center>

#### **The CJC Ignite Programme**
The CJC Ignite programme is a talent development programme in alignment to the College’s mission of “Building a generation: In Truth &amp; Love” where every CJCian is a Thinker with a Mission and a Leader with a Heart. Our integrated curriculum prepares students to be critical thinkers and future-oriented leaders, through providing them with the opportunities to ask difficult questions, uncover core theories and analyse complex problems. Students from the Ignite Programme not only achieve excellent results in the GCE A-Level examination, they are also recognised for their holistic leadership qualities.

The CJC Ignite programme is built upon the following principles:
* Seminar-style pedagogy, encouraging exploration, reflection and expression of ideas
* Smaller teacher-student ratio, allowing for greater tutor-student interaction and engagement
* An authentic service learning project for a target community and / or advocacy programme
* A residential programme at NUS U-Town based on our integrated learning approach Integration of subject disciplines, through a concept-based approach
* Greater opportunities to develop life skills, communication and leadership skills

#### **Knowledge Skills**
These subjects are designed to support a rigorous course of academic study by developing higher order thinking skills, conceptual thinking, processing skills and communication skills.

General Paper – This subject develops in students the ability to think critically, explore a range of key issues of global and local significance and express their views in cogent arguments using accurate and effective language. It comprises two main modes of assessment (writing and reading comprehension) to ensure that students are familiar with the skills required to write an academic argument and to evaluate and assess academic writing. The course spans the complete two years of the junior college course.

Project Work – Students work in groups of 4-5 on a research task set at the national level. This results in a written report, a group project file, and an oral presentation of their research findings and recommendations. All aspects of Project Work are assessed in the first year (JC1).

#### **Ministry of Education (MOE) Special Programmes at CJC**
**English Language and Linguistics**<br>
English Language and Linguistics (ELL) is a subject offered at the H2 level. This subject has been offered as a national A-Level curriculum since 2009. ELL provides students with an excellent grounding in the intricacies of the English language and includes features of disciplines such as Linguistics, Psycholinguistics and Sociolinguistics.

CJC is one of the three schools offering the English Language Elective Programme (ELEP) in Singapore. This allows selected students with high aptitude for the subject to receive bond-free scholarships that include remission of school fees and an annual allowance.

#### **Local and Overseas Academic Learning Programme and Trips**

#### **CJ45 donations to be used for supporting students who require financial assistance**

<img src="/images/collegeprofile8.jpeg" style="width:40%;margin-left::55px;" align="right">

Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges faced by our students and their families, the College has decided that the donations received under our “CJ45 celebrations in 2020” will be used to support students who require financial assistance. The original aim of the CJ45 fundraising project, that is, to renovate the CJC hostel to develop a student learning hub, has been cancelled due to escalating construction costs which has rendered the project unfeasible.  
  
The College has informed all donors of the change in usage of donations. This message is to inform the remaining donors who are uncontactable. Donors with further queries may contact the College at (65) 62524083 and&nbsp;[catholic\_jc@moe.edu.sg](mailto:catholic_jc@moe.edu.sg)
