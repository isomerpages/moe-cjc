### **Our History**
Catholic Junior College was established in 1975 to unite the pre-university courses offered by various Catholic religious orders. The college represents the combined effort of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore, the Singapore Government and local philanthropists, with Dr. Ee Peng Liang serving as the inaugural chairman of the management committee.

#### **Excellence in Living and Learning**
For more than 45 years, we have been recognised as an institution founded on our values of truth and love, with an emphasis on holistic education. Both academic excellence and a strong moral and social character remain hallmarks of the CJC student. We are prepared for a changing global landscape, steadfast to the values that remain relevant to this day.  
  
Today, we continue to grow as a vibrant, diverse community. We strive to become thinkers with a mission, leaders with a heart. An alumnus of the college is known to be bold, articulate and always committed towards doing right in the world.
