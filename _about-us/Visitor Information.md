### **Visitor Information**
**Catholic Junior College Traffic Management Plan**Â \[[Download here](/files/trafficmanagementplan.pdf)]

**Registration**<br>
Visitors to the college are required to register at the main entrance.

**Drop-off**<br>
To prevent congestion along Whitley Road during peak hours (0800 - 0840), we advise students to alight from the vehicle at a safe point along the driveway. Vehicles may exit via Malcolm Road before 0915 hours.

**Pick-up**<br>
To prevent overcrowding at the pick-up point, we advise parents to park along the slope while waiting for their child to arrive at the foyer.

**Parking**<br>
Parents and invited guests are welcome to park at the assigned lots along the slope or use the car park facing the Performing Arts Centre.

**Environment**<br>
We advise all visitors turn off their car engine while waiting at the pick-up / drop-off point. In addition to conserving energy, this helps us preserve a conducive, smoke-free environment for students and staff at the foyer.
