### **Our Identity**
#### **College Crest**
<img src="/images/crest.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-left:15px;" align="right">

The principal symbol of Catholic Junior College (CJC) is the Holy Spirit. The&nbsp;**Spirit of God**, depicted by the dove, guides the College in every word, thought and deed.

The Spirit helps keep the Body of Christ - the Church, alive. Christ, symbolised by the cross, animates the CJC community so that we act ‘In Truth and Love’, in and beyond the College.  
  
The college motto,&nbsp;**In Veritate et Caritate**&nbsp;('In Truth and Love') speaks of our mission to nurture students who will be thinkers and leaders that  
uphold integrity, and are driven by the desire to serve and improve the world around them.  
  
The&nbsp;**College**&nbsp;**Flame**&nbsp;reinforces the idea that the light of God, knowledge and wisdom must lead the way in doing that.  
  
The Crest, in the shape of a shield, depicts the armour needed to guard ourselves from what is contrary to God’s ways. It is clad in gold to signify how we treasure the College’s Catholic identity and to remind us of the pursuit of excellence in learning and living.

#### **College Motto**
The college motto&nbsp;**In Veritate et Caritate**&nbsp;('In Truth and Love') implies seeking the truth about the universe, about ourselves, about God. But truth alone is not sufficient. There must be love - a love based on understanding and reason.  
  
In Veritate et Caritate carries St Paul's message, a call to love and live among the followers of Christ: 'If we live by the truth and in love, we shall grow in all ways into Christ, who is the Head, by whom the whole body is fitted and joined together, every joint adding its own strength for each separate part to work according to its function, so the body grows until it has built itself up, in love' (Ephesians 4:15-16).

#### **College Flag**

The College Flag provides a setting for the College Crest - the two shades of blue that are used in the college uniform and blazer.  
  
The Crest is placed at the intersection of Y or gamma which is the Greek letter for ‘c’ and is also taken as the form of the Christian Cross. The Flag provides a powerful rallying point for students and the broader College Community in the distinctive College colours.

#### **College Anthem**
We are heirs of a glorious kingdom<br>
Of treasures past ages have bestowed<br>
Of the truth wisdom love and peace<br>
We rejoice to proclaim and uphold<br>
Live in Truth live in Faith and Love<br>
Let our light spread and brighten the night<br>
Let our flame warm all hearts and unite
