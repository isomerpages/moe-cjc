#### **The Dove**

The Dove is the Spirit of God. At the end of the flood, whose symbolismÂ refers to Baptism, a dove released by Noah returns with a fresh olive-tree branch in its beak as a sign that the earth was again habitable. When Christ comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes down upon him and remains with him.

Loved by God, we live in the Spirit and bear the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.

#### **The Flame**

The Flame is the Eternal Light that shines on us. 

The Flame empowers us as Thinkers with Wisdom and Purpose, 
and as Leaders with Courage and Heart to make positive change in the World around us.

Within the Flame burns three colors.

Red symbolizes Love. Love understood as reflecting the highest ideals. Love that transforms, love that inspires, love that endures.

Orange symbolizes sacrifice. Sacrifice born out of a love that is shown in deeds more than words so that others may have life.

Yellow symbolizes Truth. Truth encompasses the character of the person, standing with Integrity and Dignity. Truth drives the constant pursuit of perfection of Knowledge and endeavors others to do the same.

The Flame symbolizes all that we hold dear in this College and all that we hope to offer in service to the world through the men and women who pass through the doors of our College.
