**Mrs Phyllis Lim, Principal**

At Catholic Junior College (CJC), we have the mission of developing “Thinkers with a Mission and Leaders with a Heart”. We undertake this mission with deep passion and conviction as Singapore’s only Catholic mission junior college with 47 years of rich history, tradition and ethos. Our strong record of academic and co-curricular achievements is a hallmark of our passion and dedication to develop a range of rigorous educational programmes that provide our students with a holistic education that illuminates the heart, mind, body and spirit. Underpinning the CJC experience is our motto “In Veritate et Caritate” (In Truth and Love). It underscores our deep belief in nurturing students to be thinkers and leaders with a purpose-driven life and desire to serve others.


Each year, students from our 15 affiliated secondary schools and more than 100 secondary schools across Singapore join the CJ family. The rich diversity of talents in our student community makes CJC a vibrant and exciting place to learn, lead and excel. Anchored by a dedicated and caring team of teachers who are equipped with sound teaching practices and approaches, CJC provides a rich learning environment that ignites our students’ passion for learning and inquiry. Our teachers believe that every student matters and will strive to help every CJCian discover and develop his or her strengths and talents in order to fulfil their aspirations. We provide many platforms to stretch our students’ intellectual horizons and inculcate in them the passion to use their gifts in service of others. Besides challenging academic projects that take learning beyond the classroom, every CJCian is involved in service learning through local and overseas community involvement projects. We aim to instill in every CJCian a passion and duty to serve the college, community and beyond.


Our College theme “Hearts Ablaze, One Flame, One Family” rallies all CJCians to lead and serve in truth and love as one CJ family. Our students are inspired to feel a strong sense of belonging, experience a culture of care and to contribute their ideas and talents towards a common good and shared purpose.


The future holds exciting possibilities. We welcome you to peruse our website to learn about the exciting learning opportunities CJC has to offer. We warmly welcome you to join the CJ family and embark on an exciting, life-changing learning journey to be a Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart. I look forward to an exciting and meaningful journey with each one of you at CJC.
