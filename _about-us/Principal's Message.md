<h3><strong>Principal's Message</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to CJC!</p>
<p>Established in 1975 by the Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore to provide
a two-year pre-university course anchored in Catholic ethos, Catholic Junior
College (CJC) is the only Catholic mission junior college in Singapore.
Guided by the school motto, <em>In Veritate et Caritate</em> which means <em>In Truth and Love</em>,
the college provides quality A-Level education to students by encouraging
them to seek the truth about the universe, about themselves and about God,
and to seek to live in truth and love for others. To this end, the mission
of CJC is to build a generation in Truth and Love and nurture Every CJCian
to be a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.</p>
<p>We believe that every CJCian has the intellectual capacity, sense of social
responsibility and compassion to navigate and thrive amidst the vagaries
and challenges of this VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous)
world, make informed interpretations of information that come their way
and devote their time and effort to champion worthy causes for the less
fortunate in society. We believe that every CJCian has the gumption to
lead for the interest and betterment of society, to respect and promote
the dignity of the human person, and to build their community in solidarity
with others. Indeed, past batches of CJCians have gone on to impact society
in their own ways, such as being in service of others through their vocation
and volunteer work.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>CJC’s relocation to the vicinity of the Punggol Digital District in 2034</h4>
<p>As the expiry of the lease of the current campus approaches, CJC is given
the option to remain at the current location and completely rebuild, based
on the current specifications of junior colleges or re-locate to Punggol
in the vicinity of the Punggol Digital District, the Singapore Institute
of Technology, the future Pathlight School 3, Punggol Regional Sports Hub
and Coney Island. The decision to stay or move is a complex one, involving
rounds of evaluation and weighing pros and cons of both locations and the
educational synergies that both would offer.</p>
<p>After consulting a number of stakeholders and alumni, the SMC together
with the School Leaders made the decision to move to Punggol as it offers
a wide range of educational opportunities to enhance the value proposition
of CJC to current and future students. CJC will remain a junior college
offering the two-year A-level curriculum. It will leverage the partnerships
forged with its partners to further enhance its strengths in the Humanities
and the Sciences in the academic domains and further the holistic formation
of students through local service-learning projects serving the Punggol
community. The programmes, once confirmed, will be announced to current
students so that they can participate in them from 2026.&nbsp; It will
be a good eight years before the Punggol campus is operationally ready
in 2034, and we promise that the current campus will be upkept and maintained
up to standard to support the teaching and learning of the current batches
of students.</p>
<h4>The CJ Family – 1 Flame, 1 Family</h4>
<p>Regardless of our location, what defines CJC is not just its physical
infrastructure; we are a community, lovingly referred to by students, past
and present, as the CJ Family, and the CJ spirt will connect all associated
with CJC. Regardless of our address, we welcome CJCians to come home!</p>
<p>The pivotal role of educators at Catholic Junior College in enabling CJCians
to learn and act to build the larger community is not to be taken for granted.
Educators at CJC exemplify the college motto in their professional ethics
and interaction with students and one another, always seeking to give of
their best to students. They develop the students intellectually, form
their values and character through creating learning opportunities, and
journey with and encourage students in face of challenges that come their
way. Through our teachers’ efforts to build the college ethos, anchored
in the college motto, In Truth and Love, and family spirit of unity, CJC
is a home away from home, a safe refuge for students where they are accepted
and supported, where friendships are forged, and problems learned and overcome</p>
<p>As we enter into the next 50 years of CJC’s history, we give thanks to
God for the many blessings and graces granted upon the CJ community of
staff and students, past and present. We pray for the continued guidance
of the Holy Spirit as we refresh our value proposition as the only Catholic
mission junior college in Singapore to educate current and future CJCians.
We seek to empower our students to learn joyfully In Truth and Love and
become Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart in their chosen vocation,
in time to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>In Veritate et Caritate!</em>
