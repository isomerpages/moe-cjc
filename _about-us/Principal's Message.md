<h3><strong>Principal's Message</strong></h3><p>Established in 1975 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore, Catholic Junior College (CJC) is the only Catholic mission junior college in Singapore. Guided by the school motto, <em>In Veritate et Caritate</em> which means In Truth and Love, the college seeks to provide quality A-level education to students by encouraging them to seek the truth about the universe, about themselves and about God, and to seek to live in truth and love for others. To this end, the mission of Catholic Junior College is to build generations of students in Truth and Love and nurture every CJCian to be a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe that every CJCian has the intellectual capacity, sense of social responsibility and compassion to navigate and thrive amidst the vagaries and challenges of the VUCA world. They will make informed interpretations of information that come their way and devote their time and effort to champion worthy causes for the less fortunate in society. We believe that every CJCian has the gumption to lead for the interest and betterment of society.&nbsp;</p><p>For almost five decades, teachers at CJC have been exemplifying the college motto in their professional ethics and interaction with students and one another, always seeking to give their best to students. They develop them intellectually, form their values and character through creating learning opportunities, journey with and encourage students in the face of challenges that come their way. With our teachersâ€™ efforts to build the college ethos and family spirit, Catholic Junior College is a home away from home for students, where they are accepted and supported, friendships are forged and problems, overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>As CJC approaches its 50th anniversary in 2025, we invite all O-level students to opt not just for any A-level course, but for the <strong><em>CJC</em></strong> A-level programme. You would be offered many learning opportunities to become Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders with a Heart, just like the many illustrious CJCians who graduated from our college. We also invite all CJCians who graduated from our college to re-connect with the college through the 50th anniversary celebrations that would commence in 2024 or simply drop by the college to visit your teachers and say hi.&nbsp; Once a CJCian, always a CJCian!</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Mrs_Woo_Soo_Min_website_15_Dec_2023.jpg"></div><p></p><p><em>In Veritate et Caritate!</em></p><p><strong>Mrs Woo Soo Min</strong></p><p><strong>Principal</strong></p>
