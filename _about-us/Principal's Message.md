<h3><strong>Principal's Message</strong></h3>
<p>2025 is an exciting year for Catholic Junior College as we celebrate our
Golden Jubilee this year!</p>
<p>Established in 1975 by the Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore to provide
a two-year pre-university course anchored in Catholic Ethos, Catholic Junior
College (CJC) is the only Catholic mission junior college in Singapore.
Guided by the school motto, <em>In Veritate et Caritate</em> which means <em>In Truth and Love</em>,
the college provides quality A-Level education to students by encouraging
them to seek the truth about the universe, about themselves and about God,
and to seek to live in truth and love for others. To this end, the mission
of CJC is to build a generation in Truth and Love and nurture Every CJCian
to be a Thinker with a Mission, Leader with a Heart.</p>
<p>We believe that every CJCian has the intellectual capacity, sense of social
responsibility and compassion to navigate and thrive amidst the vagaries
and challenges of this VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous)
world, make informed interpretations of information that come their way
and devote their time and effort to champion worthy causes for the less
fortunate in society. We believe that every CJCian has the gumption to
lead for the interest and betterment of society, to respect and promote
the dignity of the human person, and to build their community in solidarity
with others. Indeed, past batches of CJCians have gone on to impact society
in their own ways, such as being in service of others through their vocation
and volunteer work.</p>
<p>The pivotal role of educators at Catholic Junior College in enabling CJCians
to learn and act to build the larger community is not to be taken for granted.
Educators at CJC exemplify the college motto in their professional ethics
and interaction with students and one another, always seeking to give of
their best to students. They develop the students intellectually, form
their values and character through creating learning opportunities, and
journey with and encourage students in the face of challenges that come
their way. Through our teachersâ€™ efforts to build the college ethos, anchored
in the college motto, In Truth and Love, and family spirit of unity, CJC
is a home away from home, a safe refuge for students where they are accepted
and supported, where friendships are forged, and problems learned and overcome.</p>
<p>As we celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the founding of Catholic Junior
College in 2025, we give thanks to God for the many blessings and graces
granted upon the CJ community of staff and students, past and present.
We pray for the continued guidance of the Holy Spirit as we refresh our
value proposition as the only Catholic mission junior college in Singapore
to educate current and future CJCians. We seek to empower them to learn
joyfully In Truth and Love and become Thinkers with a Mission, Leaders
with a Heart in their chosen vocation, in time to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CJC is not just a college; we are a community, lovingly referred to by
students, past and present, as the CJ Family.&nbsp; We welcome CJCians
and all who are part of this extended CJ family to join in our upcoming
CJ50 celebrations, aptly themed, A Family United in Truth and Love, to
reconnect and renew ties with each other:&nbsp;</p>
