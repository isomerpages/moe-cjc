### **Experience**

<img src="/images/Experience1.jpg" style="width:85%">

Life as a student in CJC isÂ **a time to live, to grow and to remember**. We hope to be your second family: meet your best friends for life, find your passion in a CCA and become a fuller person on your journey to higher education.

The CJC family spirit is clear from the moment you step into the college. Our Orientation programme will make you feel every bit a part of a vibrant student culture. From Rockafella to Alfresco, activities organised by students for students make school cool. You will never be far from what you love, with 40 **[co-curricular activities](https://moe-cjc-staging.netlify.app/experience/ccas/)** and our year-round **[house](https://moe-cjc-staging.netlify.app/experience/cjc-houses/)** competitions. Discover new interests, challenge your limits and give back to the community.
