### **2022**
#### **Overseas Travel Declaration (for JC1 students)**
To ensure that our schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we would require parents/guardians of our **JC1** students to update their child’s/ward’s travel declaration. The declaration is **compulsory** for all parents/guardians whose child/ward travelled **out of Singapore in the last 14 days** **prior to 6 Feb 2022**. If your child/ward did not travel, no action is required.

Please declare your child’s/ward’s travel plans, including both the country and city, and any transit(s) if there was any stop over at any other country/city while travelling. Make the declaration by 7 Feb 2022 at the following link [](https://for.edu.sg/cjc-jc1-traveldeclaration)[https://for.edu.sg/cjc-jc1-traveldeclaration](https://for.edu.sg/cjc-jc1-traveldeclaration) or scan the QR code here.

#### **Safe Management Measures 2022**
As we move towards living with COVID-19 as an endemic in the new normal, schools will continue to stay vigilant and adhere strictly to the Safe Management Measures (SMM) to safeguard the well-being of our students, staff and other stakeholders. Parents or guardians will only be allowed to drop off their child or ward at the college. 

Please note the following health protocols and SMM:

With further relaxation of the Safe Management Measures announced on 24 August, <u><b>mask-wearing will be optional in both indoor and outdoor settings with effect from 29 August.</u></b> These changes apply to MOE schools as well. However, please remind your child/ward that <u><b>it is still mandatory to put on his/her mask if he/she takes the public transport.</u></b>

As we strive towards living with COVID, let us continue to practise good personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility. Together, we can make the College a safer place for all.
