#### **Travel Declaration for 2021 Year-End Holidays**
Dear Parent/Guardian, to ensure schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make a **travel declaration for your child/ward only if he/she intends to travel** for the year-end holidays <u><b>by 29 October 2021 (Friday).</u></b>

We encourage you to do so via the [Parents’ Gateway (PG) app](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/). If you do not have access to [Parents’ Gateway (PG)](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/), you may do so by printing and filling out the attached form and submitting the hardcopy to the General Office (GO).

If your child/ward is travelling, please indicate clearly both the country and city of travel. Only one parent is required to declare. If your child/ward is **not travelling** during the year-end holidays, **no action is required** on your side.

When planning your travel, please refer to the attached advisory on travelling. If there is a change of travel plan(s) after declaration, please inform the school as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.<br>

#### **Precautionary Measures for Schools from 11 Oct 2021**
In line with MOH’s updates to the national COVID-19 testing and isolation protocols, MOE will update the precautionary measures from 11 Oct 2021. 

  

Students in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case will no longer be placed on Quarantine Order(QO); they will be issued a 7-day Health Risk Warning (HRW) by MOH.

MOE will no longer issue Leave of Absence (LOA) and Approved Absence (AA) to all students and staff.

Students currently under existing QO, LOA or AA can return to school for lessons if they are well and have a negative ART result on the day they go to school.

Primary schools will require close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in school to undergo regular ART self-testing while waiting for the issuance of an HRW. We seek your understanding that schools will no longer call parents to inform you that your child is a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case and will use electronic means (e.g. Parents Gateway or email) instead.

More details can be found in this joint press release by MOE and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB).<br>
