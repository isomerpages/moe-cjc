#### **Mandatory security measures for video conferencing platforms**
The Ministry of Education (MOE) had earlier suspended the use of all video conferencing (VC) platforms following the recent security breaches on the VC platform Zoom, until the security issues are ironed out. MOE will now centrally manage teachers’ Zoom accounts. This enables MOE to enforce standardised security settings consistently across all teachers using the platform. These default settings will enhance security and restrict the use of Zoom’s functionalities, while allowing Live Lessons to still take place. For example, the use of passwords will now be mandatory for all lessons, while screen sharing, screen annotation and whiteboarding will be disabled and locked centrally. 

In addition, teachers are now required to comply with protocols and practices to ensure the safe use of VC platforms such as verifying the identity of individual students before admitting them into the lesson. Teachers must confirm their compliance with these measures before they are allowed to resume using them for teaching.

The Ministry will allow for the progressive resumption of VC platforms as these are good tools for motivating students to learn. As long as individual teachers have put these additional measures in place and have familiarised themselves with the security protocols as required, they can resume the use of VC platforms for HBL.

These multiple levels of security are intended to ensure a safe teaching and learning environment for our students and teachers. Please click on the Ministry's [webpage](https://www.moe.gov.sg/faqs-covid-19-infection) for information on the latest measures.

#### **Guidelines on the use of masks and face shields in school**
The Ministry of Health has just [announced](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/guidance-for-use-of-masks-and-face-shields) that with effect from **2 Jun 2020**, face shields will be treated differently from masks. Masks will now be required as the default when you are outside your home.

Face shields will only be allowed in place of masks for specific exempt groups or settings, where the wearing of masks may not be practical. They are:

\- Children 12 years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping masks on for a prolonged period of time;

\- Persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time; and

\- Persons, including teachers, who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting, where they are able to maintain a safe distance from others.

In view of the latest announcement, students in secondary schools and JC/CI **should not** be wearing face shields unless they have a certified health condition as highlighted. We would like to seek parents’ assistance in ensuring that your children are equipped with the appropriate gear when returning to school, and that they know how to use and store them safely.

If your children, or anyone in the home is unwell, do take them to the doctor and stay home till they have recovered. Let us all do our part to keep the school community safe.

Thank you and stay safe and healthy.

#### **Expanded Testing for COVID-19**
Since 2 Jun, the government has expanded surveillance testing for COVID-19. We would like to share the Ministry of Health's guidelines and what it means for our students.

Parents/guardians should accompany their children who are unwell, with respiratory symptoms like cough, sore throat and runny nose, to see a doctor and be assessed for Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). If diagnosed with ARI:

*   Students (13 years and above) will be prioritised for COVID-19 testing and referred for testing at a polyclinic, designated GP clinic participating in the Swab-and-Send-Home initiative or Regional Screening Centre set up by the Health Promotion Board.

  

*   Students (12 years and below) will be assessed by the doctor as to whether a test is required, as younger children may require different clinical considerations than older children. Those who do not require a test will be issued a 5-day MC and should stay home. If he/she is still unwell at the end of 5 days, he/she should return to the same doctor for follow-up assessment and may be referred to KKH/NUH for a test.

The student pass with NRIC/FIN number is required for testing.

Please note that there may be exceptions, depending on the professional judgement of the doctor.

Testing will also apply to school staff, complementing the other safe management measures put in place in our schools to safeguard student well-being. For more details, please refer to the MOE [FAQs](https://www.moe.gov.sg/faqs-covid-19-infection).

Stay safe and healthy!
