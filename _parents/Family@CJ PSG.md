<h3><strong>Supporting Parents to Support Our Children</strong></h3>
<p>The Family@CJ Parent Support Group (PSG) comprises parents who support
the College’s mission and vision, and support other parents in our parenting
journey. The motto of the PSG is <strong><em>‘To Love and to Serve’</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The Family@CJ PSG logo was created by past PSG members. The logo is encircled
by three hands encapsulating the strong tripartite partnership between
the school, students and parents in promoting holistic education; one that
develops every CJCian to be a <em>Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart</em>.
The three hands represented in the college colours of blue, red and yellow,
highlight parents' fervent support in fulfilling the college’s mission
and vision <em>in Truth and in Love</em>.</p>
