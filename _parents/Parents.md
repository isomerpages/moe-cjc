### **Supporting Parents to Support Our Children**

The Family@CJ Parent Support Group (PSG) comprises parents who support the College’s mission and vision, and support other parents in our parenting journey. The motto of the PSG is ***‘To Love and to Serve'***.

The Family@CJ PSG logo was created by past PSG members. The logo is encircled by three hands encapsulating the strong tripartite partnership between the school, students and parents in promoting holistic education; one that develops every CJCian to be a *Thinker with a Mission and Leader with a Heart*. The three hands represented in the college colours of blue, red and yellow, highlight parents' fervent support in fulfilling the college’s mission and vision in Truth and in Love.
